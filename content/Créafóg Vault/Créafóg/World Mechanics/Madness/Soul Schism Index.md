The Soul Schism Index is measured by calculating psi (Ψ), aka C<sub>sf</sub>, which is the Coefficient of Soul Fracture. This represents the deterioration of a character's mental state due to various stresses and traumas. The coefficient is represented by a numerical value between 0 and 1 that increases with exposure to traumatic events, forbidden and protected knowledge, dark magic, and stressful experiences.

# Severity based increments: 
Different events have varying impacts on psi, represented by different dice rolls, multiplied by 0.01:
- Mild events: 1d4
- Moderate events: 1d6
- Significant events: 1d8
- Severe events: 1d12
This number can also be expressed as a percentage by multiplying by 100.

It is possible, albeit either difficult, resource heavy, or time-consuming, to decrease one's psi. Rest, magical healing from soul mages and clerics, therapy, or significant personal achievement. Each recovery method decrements a creature's psi percentage through a reverse mechanism of the increment system (e.g. rolling a die of appropriate effectiveness and multiplying the outcome by -0.01).

Whenever a saving throw is called for, use the following formula to determine the DC:  
DC = 10 + (10 x Ψ + Ψ mod) - Int/Wis/Cha mod

Each threshold adds a new trigger effect. When the trigger effect is triggered, roll a d100 and multiply to outcome by 0.01. If the number is less than or equal to your current Soul Schism Index, the number rolled represents the triggered effect that occurs. A player who rolls above their psi level triggers the effect of their current level. A creature can't trigger the effect of an effect above their current psi level. Should the ruling be: nothing triggers if a creature rolls above their current psi level? Explore this option and implications at some point.

## Effect triggers:
- Anytime a creature's Soul Schism Index increases
- Failing a mental stat saving throw by more than X
- Failing a mental stat saving throw by rolling a 1 also increases the creature's Soul Schism Index by 1d6, thereby triggering another psi threshold effect
- Rolling a 1 when casting a spell
- A creature can use their action choose to trigger an effect of the creature's choice whose threshold they have already passed. The strain causes the creature's psi to increase. The negligible threshold increases the creature's psi by 1d4%, mild 1d6%, moderate 1d8%, significant 1d10%, severe 1d12%.
## Selling your soul
Any creature may utilize their soul as a form of payment in transactions with other creatures that deal in souls as currency. When using your soul as currency, you don't necessarily sell the whole thing at once, and should be on the lookout for those creatures that would tell you otherwise. You may sell a certain percentage of your soul as you desire. Divide that percentage by 100 to express it as a decimal and increase your Psi by that amount.
Note that when a creature sells a part of its soul, that creatures Soul Schism Index can not be decreased lower than the total percentage of their soul that was sold, as expressed as a decimal. For example, the Psi of a creature that has sold 4% of its soul to a night hag, 13% to a chain devil, and 2% to an arcanaloth cannot be lower than 0.19 without regaining those fragments.
