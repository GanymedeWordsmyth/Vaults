# Druid Circle of the Oracle  
Throughout history, many things are thought. Throughout history many thoughts are lost and forgotten. Some even before the thinker realizes the thoughts were ever thought, never to be thought again. Except...what if there was a way to rethink these thoughts? What if there was a way to retrieve them? To relive them? In an incredibly rare instance a particular type of person, a particular type of Druid, just might be able to see these thoughts. Of these very, very few, one might even be able to...tap into these thoughts, experience these thoughts, and even learn from them.
 
The Druid Circle of the Oracle is a subclass that is devoted to learning information from the depths of a place that cannot be reached by common or uncommon means. The minds of those long since passed. As the Druid hones this particular skill, they become far better at gathering information through a silky wisp that floats through the air like a fine spidery thread called a Gossamer left behind by any and all thinking creatures. Image being able to learn about the past by seeing through the eyes of those belonging to that era.

#### Circle Spells  
Your connection with nature has allowed you to gain knowledge and insight that others wouldn't normally have. At 2nd level, you can see forgotten and lost trains of thought. You learn the *encode thoughts* cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Oracle Spells table.
 
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Eyes of the Oracle  
Starting at 2nd level, you can spend an action to heighten your sense of sight and search your surroundings for thin wisps of fine spider silk of lost and forgotten thoughts within 30ft for 1 hour. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.
 
At 6th level, you can use the *encode thoughts* cantrip to gain more insight into any thought you absorb. While Eyes of the Oracle is active, you can see a creature's entire train of thought and the physical situation they were in when they had it (example: what they were hearing, seeing, and doing). This ability also gives you the direction and distance from you of the creature who's memory you absorbed as long as you are on the same plane of existence. If the creature is on another plane of existence, this ability will tell you on which plane that creature is.
 
At 10th level, Eyes of the Oracle allows you to read the intentions of others. When you focus on a creature while Eyes of the Oracle is active, you learn their alignment, when that person is lying to you, and their creature type. You can only focus on one person at a time.
 
At 14th level, Eyes of the Oracle grants you blindsight out to 30 feet while Eyes of the Oracle is active. Through this sense you can only perceive thinking creatures. Any creature with an intelligence of 3 or less can't be perceived through this sense.
 
#### Awakened Thoughts  
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic to your heightened senses. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and gain the following benefits.  
- Telepathy 120ft  
- Your ability to see into the minds of others allows you to know how they will behave in combat granting you advantage on saving throws against their spells and abilities and gives them disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
 
These benefits last for 10 minutes, or until you use your Wild Shape again.
 
#### Inception  
At 6th, can plant thoughts into an unwilling creature and that creature will think of that thought as though they thought it themselves. The thought must be one in which the receiver would find to be reasonable, otherwise the thought has nothing in the creature's mind to hold on to. The creature must make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours. On a fail, the creature believes that the thought originated within the creature and acts accordingly. Creatures with an intelligence of 3 or less are immune to this effect. Creatures that are unconscious, or are a target of your *detect thoughts* spell, make the saving throw with disadvantage. If the creature is subjected to a *remove curse* or similar spell, the creature can see that the thought was planted there by magic.

#### Mentalist  
At 10th level, your mastery over the mental realm allows you to expand your mind and manipulate those around you to a small degree. You can use a bonus action to cast *sanctuary* with a range of self. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest
 
#### Iron Mind  
At 14th level, you're ability to see into the minds of others hardens your own mind. You are immune to being charmed and frightened. Additionally, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.
