Background:  
Buppido sees the grey ooze attacking Ront for the "faceless lord" as a sign that Ront makes a good sacrifice to any worthy God and takes it upon himself to sacrifice Ront to Diinkarazan, his "true form."
 
Box Text:  
When you wake to travel, you notice that [Ront?] is still lying down in his bed. As you approach, you notice that Ront is laying on his back with his arms crossed on his chest. His legs are straight and toes are pointed.
