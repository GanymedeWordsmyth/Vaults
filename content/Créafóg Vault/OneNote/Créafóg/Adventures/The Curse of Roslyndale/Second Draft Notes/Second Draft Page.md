# The Curse of Roslyndale
 
Mistress Westra Lackman, a woman already in mourning after losing her husband, tragically lost all three of her children to a plague that ravaged the otherwise sleepy town of Roslyndale. Desperate to have her children returned to her, she hired the aid of Mr Henry Cotton, the local wizard new to the town. Sadly, Mr. Cotton was not of a high enough level to cast the necessary resurrection spells. Unluckily for Mr Cotton, Mistress Lackman also knew about his past from which he was running, and was using it as blackmail, so he had no alternative than to find someway around his restriction.
 
As her patience grew thin, Mr Cotton was unable to test the ritual after completing a working prototype before the Mistress found out and forced him to execute it prematurely, his despondent pleas falling on deaf ears. The ritual, having been so close to the end, yet still too far out of reach, was a complete disaster. A shock wave billowed out and engulfed the entire village, destroying all in its path.
 
The village and its residents are now trapped in a time rift, forced to relive the final day of their demise, ending each day with that fateful shock wave that swept through the town in the dead of night.
 
## Background - Make a note that the village hides cursed items
 
Long ago, an adventuring party decided to settle down after losing one of their own. The went by the name of The Grove, and each member was associated with their own flower.  
* Millie Kinsley was a human open-fist monk who prefered her fists to any weapons, as weapons can often be confiscated. She was known as the Wandering Flower.  
* Gorren Ramski, the cook of the group, was known as the Oaken Tansey. He was a human desert storm herald barbarian; his rage set ablaze everything around him.  
* Aranor Thalis, a rare surface drow, was associated with the Crimson Belladonna, and was the thief of the party. She knew her way around a lock and almost seemed to teleport between shadows.  
* Kairon, the one who was lost, was the Violet Snapdragon. They were a tiefling bard whos favorate instrument was the violin. As they sang, things popped into and out of existence around them.  
* And finally, Mr. Heward Lackman, the White Chrysanthemum. A powerful wizard, and avid researcher. His expertise lied in the realm of the ancient world.
 
This tale largely revolves around the wife of Mr. Lackman, though your players will meet the rest of the adventuring party. She now goes by the name Mistress Lackman and is the main antagonist, though that should not be immediately apparent to your players. After losing her children and with no way to contact her husband, either because he is out of contact or is dead, she made terrible choices in secret with a grave cost.
 
## How to use this module
 
While at night, when the party receives a decent amount of information as to what is happening, they wake up where they fell asleep. The first time or two this happens should feel like they merely had a shared dream. During this adventure, the atmosphere you should portray is cosmic horror and following this advice will help keep that tension and mystery.
 
The white boxes are box text to read to your players directly. Feel free to edit these as you see fit. Some of the text in these boxes will be bolded. This is to denote that you, as the DM, are waiting for the characters to do something before reading the rest of the box text. Anything in a box text that is italicized is a note to you, the DM, that instructs you to do something.
 
With each box text, I would recommend calling out that you, the DM, are about to read...well...box text. I usually say something like, "alright, this next part is a cutscene," or literally just, "box text" then read the text. By calling it out, you encourage the players to keep their questions until the end so you can read the text smoothly.
 
## Hooks and Player Buy-in
 
* The players can become aware of Roslyndale through rumors or idle conversation with shopkeepers and innkeepers of nearby settlements. The party may hear things such as, "something strange is going on in a nearby town" or even a legend of the nearby village of a woman who lost her children and still haunts the area. "While traveling the king's road, about halfway to the next town, I swear I saw lanterns down the way, not that I went anywhere near the lanterns. Those who do, don't return."
 
* The local government hears of the party's deeds and sends them into Roslyndale, a well kept secret for the safety of the citizens, to destroy the curse
 
* The head of a local mercenery group is looking for something, ingredients, information, legendary items, etc. Defeating the Mistress and destroying the curse is the only way to gain access to whatever the head of the guild needs.

# Roslyndale Dreams
 
You can opt to walk a PC through the following dream either in private or with every one else around to give them a hint as to what is happening in the town. The figure in the beginning is written to be Kelemvor as an example, but feel free to change it to be who or whatever you feel is most appropriate or omit the figure entirely. Also, the dreams are written to fit in my world. It describes the sun and moons and the Sovereign Concordat, which is basically a country wide police force. Feel free to change this around however you need to fit your setting.
 
Read everything verbatim except for what is in bold. Anything in bold is a note for you as the DM. When you see an ellipsis (…) it will be followed by a number. Skip the remainder of the text until you find the corresponding ellipses that begins with the matching number. Italics denote speech.
 
## Pre-Arrival Dream
 
**Show the picture titled, "Hooded figure from the Dream"**
 
You awaken in a dark liminal space. You can barely make out any details in the distance. A hooded figure wearing black robes and a long, beaked mask calmly approaches you. The figure holds a lantern in one hand and offer the other to you as if to beckon for yours. Do you take it?
 
You grasp the figure's hand, and together you face ahead. The figure lifts the lantern, and the engulfing darkness fades, leaving you at the entrance to a foresaken village. Turning to your right, you find the figure vanished, along with the hand you were just holding.
 
As you look around you notice the settlement is completely barren and delapidated. The night is cold and dark with a faint bit of moonlight shining from the two moons, Aide and Minuris. A low fog hangs over the desolate town, heavy, yet transparent. There is a faint noise in the distance, rhythmic and chaotic. You are too far away to be able to identify it.
 
As you observe a plank tumble from a window of a boarded-up house. Looking back up, you suddenly realize you are now standing amidst a graveyard. A walking circle is laid out around a withered cherry tree, the center of this solemn space. From the tree, three distinct paths branch out: the central one leading to a statue, the right to a clearing, and the left toward a Mausoleum. The rhythmic sound that greeted you at the town's entrance now echoes more intensely off the gravestones, still elusive in its origin. Which path do you choose to follow?
 
**Skip to read only the path the player chooses. Do not read them another path other than what they choose.**
 
<div style='margin-top:178px'></div>
 
### Statue path
 
You arrive at the marble statue depicting a woman clutching three children tightly, her face contorted in anguish. The hooded figure floats at head level with the statue and runs a hand across her cheek. Tears of blood stream down the statue's face as you hear from the woman rhythmic wails and sobs. It's the same sound you've been hearing since you entered the village. There is a plaque at the base of the statue that's too hard to read. You move closer to the statue to inspect it further and a single blue flame emerges by one of the children. Then another. And a third. You are taken aback as the three flames dance around the statue. What do you do?
 
As you do, the flames stop dancing and shift aggressively towards you before charging in your direction their light blinding you for a moment. When your eyes finally refocus, …1
 
### Clearing path - Should lead to Mr Cotton's House - Rewrite later
 
You arrive standing in the middle of a clearing in the graveyard, wind howling ominously. It seems as though there was once something in the middle of the clearing, but has since been removed. The black-hooded figure stands where the soil is now disturbed looking in your direction. As your eyes focus, you can hear an older woman scolding someone. It sounds as though the two of them are right in front of you, though you don't see anyone. This is the sound you have been hearing since you entered this little village.
 
"*This is a terrible idea Mistress. Bringing people back is tremendously dangerous!*" An elderly man retorts sheepishly.
 
"*I care not for the consequences Mr Cotton. I paid you your price and you will obey. Or do I need to send word to the Sovereign Concordat?*" threatens the woman.
 
"*No Mistress, I will complete the ritual,*" he acquiesces.
 
The howling wind crescendos into a powerful serge, kicking up dirt and leaves, causing you to instinctually put your arms up defensively, averting your eyes. When you put your arms down and open your eyes, …1
 
### Mausoleum path
 
You arrive at the mausoleum and can see a name above the door, but it is out of focus and hard to read. After a few moments, you feel your feet walk foward as you are drawn into the mausoleum and find yourself in a small marble room. In the center of the room is a black stone statue of a robed figure wearing a long beaked mask. In the crook of the figure's arm rests a winged staff with two snakes coiling around the middle. Palms up, the figure's thumbs, first fingers, and pinkies touch at the tips and the middle and ring fingers are curled in so they touch at the first knuckle.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
The three walls recess to form three shelves. On the left shelf rests an urn depicting Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface and a small wooden doll carved out of walnut. The shelf on the back wall hosts an urn depicting Veraudinus, the sun, at his zenith shining gloriously down over the world and a child sized wooden sword and bow both carved out of maple. In the shelf on the right sits an urn depicting Minuris shining resplendently in the midnight sky. Next to this urn sits a marionette carved from ash wood. **DC12 nature check reveals that these woods represents different aspects of the spiritual world.** You hear a woman crying behind you through the door you just walked in from. The rhythm is the same as the rhythm you heard when you first entered the village and again when you arrived in the graveyard. Do you approach the door? You walk through the door and find …1
 
#### 1…
 
You are in a hallway. There are three doors along the right side wall and two on the left, each framing a moderately sized bust mirror. There is a staircase behind you. You know that one direction leads upwards, and the other leads towards the exit. Along the back wall is another door, in one of the mirrors, you see the hooded figure slowly opens the door and enters. The sound of a crying woman resounding from within. What do you do?
 
**All other doors are locked. If the player tries to leave the hallway down the staircase (the only other place they can go), read the following:** You take a step down the staircase behind you and hear a soft masculine voice in your ear, "*Now, now Mistress. We need to get you to bed.*"  
"*But that's where they…*" You can't finish your sentence before a small whimper leaves your lips.**
 
You glance into one of the mirrors as you walk towards the door and see the reflection of a man in the mirror with his arm around your shoulder as overwhelming cries of sorrow burst forth from the depths of your soul. You look back towards the door and your hands come up and meet your face as you continue to sob into them. You continue forward, ever walking. Towards the door. It seems like an eternity. Your grief is endless. Immeasurable. At last, you come to the door and the moment your fingers graze it, all is quiet. The man is gone, your clothes are your own. You are your own. You take a second to ground yourself, then feel yourself push silently into the room and see a woman crying in a corner arms outstretched onto an elegant four post bed. Over the bed hovers three distinct blue flames. She also glows a faint bluish hue. In the opposite corner stands the hooded figure, watching you. What do you do?  
```  
```  
**Read this next part quickly**
 
You take a step and a board groans beneath your weight. Instantly, the woman's head whips towards you, her gaze piercing your soul for a fleeting second before she unleashes a blood-curdling scream! She rises and sweeps her hand across the distance. An invisible force hurls you into the nearby closet and the door slams shut with a resounding thud. The darkness creeps in, suffocating and oppressive, as the walls seem to close in on you. Suddenly, a hand emerges through the door, phasing through your flesh and grips your heart with an frigid, unyielding grasp. Fingers and nails, long and sharp, piercing slowly into your heart as the woman's head phases through the door and shrieks, "You are mine!"
 
**Pause, then continue to read this next part quickly, as well**
 
You awaken gasping for breath, your head pounding as though you've been holding your breath for far too long you grasp at your heart scrambling to find its beat and you feel nothing. You rip your shirt open and look down. There upon your chest, right where your heart is, lies a bruise in the shape of a hand print. As you place your hand upon the bruise a horrible pain shoots through your entire body and you convulse backwards, the back of your head plows into the pillow and all goes black.
 
**Long pause. Then read slowly**
 
Th-dump
 
Th-dump
 
Th-dump
 
**Pause**
 
As you lie in bed, eyes closed, you feel its beat. Slow, rhythmic. You are left with two words stuck in your head: *Bring Peace*

# Arrival  
The party should arrive just after noon. Enough time to enter the village and visit a couple shops and get their bearings before they have to head over to the only Inn in town, The Wandering Flower, run by Millie and Henry Kinsley. Named thusly after what Henry used to call his wife when she was an adventurer. The Kinsleys offer rooms starting at 5sp.
 
Have the characters notice that the quaint little town is a little run down and could use some love and attention. As the party roams the town, make sure to keep track of what the party buys and how much they spend at each shop. This information will be important later if those same shops are visited after dark.
 
As you roleplay the townsfolk, keep in mind that the goal is to make the players feel like something is off about this place. I played the townfolk as sickly sweet and overly helpful and that seemed to do very well. Another thing you can do is when a player character asks a shopkeeper a question, answer that question as though it is related to the products in the shop. The same can be done with other non-shopkeeper townsfolk too. As an example, one of my characters asked about some undead that could possibly be around the town, and the herbalist responded with, "Oh yes, I think we have some of that in the back." Then brought out some kind of dried and crushed herb blend.
 
At some point, have the characters notice a figure wearing all black from head to toe enter a shop. This should happen around 1pm. I did this as they approached the town when they were still too far to make out any details, but feel free to let them get their bearings first. When the party enters the shop to investigate, read them the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
As you enter the shop, the air is rich with the tantalizing aromas of fresh cakes, warm pastries, and sweet icing. At the counter, a woman in a sophisticated black, floor-length dress and elbow-length gloves concludes her transaction. Her delicate lace veil, as fine as spider silk, barely obscures her face. She nods to you, her voice wavering slightly, "It's nice to see some new faces around here." Though her veil conceals her expression, her voice hints at suppressed tears. With a graceful curtsey and a "Fairweather, Mr. Marlborough," she departs.
 
"Fairweather to you too, Mistress," replies the shopkeeper, turning to greet you. "A tragedy for her, losing all three loved ones to the plague not long ago. But let me not dampen your spirits," he says, his tone becoming more upbeat. "I'm Mr. Marlborough, and this is my bakery. Welcome! How can I help you today?"  
</div>
 
> ##### **Plot point:**  
>  
> It's marginally important that they rent a room at the Wandering Flower on their first night, for reasons that become apparent later. Though, if the party insists that they stay elsewhere for the evening, feel free to let them. You'll just have to do some DM magic behind the scenes a bit and change some of the language going forward. The party will wake up each morning in the spot they chose to bed down on the first night.
 
### Rumormill
 
As with most small towns, gosip spreads throughout like a wildfire in a forest during dry season. The following can be used to immerse the players further and give them an insight into what was happening in the days leading up to the end of Roslyndale. Feel free to add your own happenings to this list in laying the seeds for future adventures. These rumors can be used anywhere in the town, such as overheard in the market square, the commons, or the tavern. As with most rumors, the conjectures are largely untrue, and parts of the fact may also be partially incorrect, misheard, or misrepresented.
 
- Mistress Lackman has been spending quite an amount of time with Mr Henry Cotton. Most conclude that this means they are having an affair. They curse her name a little, but mostly his, since he is married to Eleanor. Those who curse her name for this assume she is forcing him into the affair, which isn't entirely wrong, which you'll read later.  
- Strange lights and noises are coming from the Lackman Estate most nights, especially on the 3rd floor. Most conclude that Mr Lackman, quite an accomplished wizard, had some untoward magical experiments that has now started going awry in his absence.  
- Mr Lackman is known for traveling to ruins for study. Some conclude that he was having an affair with other people.  
- Mr Heward Lackman has been gone for a very long time. Most conclude that he either ran as far away from Mistress Lackman as could, or died on an excursion to some magical ruins.

# The First Night
 
Every evening at 1:30am the spell failure occures, causing a shockwave to roll through the town. This wakes every *living* creature in town, including the PCs. Whenever the party rests within the bounds of Roslyndale, have everyone roll a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw at this time. Since nothing significant happened between their arrival and now, and they've likely had some downtime during travel to Roslyndale, they shouldn't need a full long rest.
 
> ##### Plot point:  
>  
> Remind everyone before going to sleep that they only reset their character sheets and choose new spells and such at the *end* of a long rest.
 
For anyone that failed their Wisdom Saving Throw, read them the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
Something jostles you awake this night, though you aren't sure what. A loud sound? A rumbling in the earth? It's difficult to tell. You remind yourself that it was probably just the town's wildlife like in the many towns you've been in before. You lie with your eyes still closed trying to return to sleep when you hear the sound of a child's laughter as they play just outside your window.  
</div>
 
If any of the party members want to fall back to sleep, have those players roll another DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw. Whoever decided to go back to sleep skips to the next day unless the ones who didn't jostle them awake. Those that fail have their slumber wracked with nightmares. Have anyone who failed roll a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. The nightmares of those who fail this save turn to night terrors and they wake up with a level of exhaustion and don't benefit from a long rest.
 
If any of them get up to investigate, read the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you open your eyes, you notice the modestly cared for room you fell asleep in is completely desolate. The walls are gray and mostly peeled off. The floors are long since rotted and splintered. There is a large gaping whole to what looks to be a crawl space in the corner by the door. What do you do?  
</div>
 
```  
```
 
If the party makes their way towards the tavern, read the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You walk down the hall and into the tavern. Looking around, you see the money you gave to the Kinsleys to pay for the room is still right where you left it. Neither Millie nor Henry are in sight, although from experience, you know that after a certain time, innkeepers retire to their quarters not to far from the front desk. You see a small bell sitting on the counter that you hadn't noticed before. Late comers often ring the bell to summon the sleeping innkeepers.  
</div>
 
If anyone tries to pick up and ring the bell, the clapper falls to the floor, old and rusted. The bell itself has a gaping hole on the side that was facing away from the party. A door opens and dull footsteps are heard approaching from down the hallway. If the party waits or investigates, they'll find that there is no one there.
 
If the party ate here during the day, anyone looking around the room will notice a small pile of coin sitting on the table where they were eating at earlier. It's in the exact amount and denomination that the party spent on food and drink.
 
Regardless of whether or not the party experiences this, when they do decide to leave, have everyone roll a perception check. The highest check notices first that a second story window of the house about a 5 minute walk away glows with a faint bluish hue.
 
If the party continues to this house, skip ahead to the farmer's house section.
 
> ##### Note  
>  
> Even though this section is called The First Night, this plays out every evening the party stays in Roslyndale.  
>  
> Also, unless the party starts at sundown, each night has about enough time to explore 2 houses or areas.  
>  
> If they do start at sundown, they have about enough time to explore 4 or 5 houses or areas.  
>  
> Any party member that is awake during the spell failure will see a massive blue shock wave envelope the entire village.  
>  
> Once sunrise occurs, the party awakens where ever they went to sleep

# Decaying Townsfolk
 
As the days progress, the townsfolk slowly start to resemble their actual dead nature and they become increasingly irate at the presence of the party. The following is a guide to how the town and its residence look and act towards the party depending on how many days have passed. This section only goes into effect after the the party finishes their first night. Ergo, the following section titled "The First Day" is the day after the party arrived.
 
No matter what stage decay the townsfolk are in, as soon as the sun sets, during the short period of twilight, all of the citizens start to fade away until the sun has completely set. As the twilight fades, the townsfolk fade with it, until they are completely gone. The bodies of the children during this time fade to the familiar blue floating flames that are the Will-o'-Wisps.
 
### The First Day
 
Anyone with a passive Perception of 16 (DC14 if calling rolls) and above will notice the residents are gaunt and haggard with pale, ashen skin.
 
The residents are still pleasant, but their sickly sweet demeanor is replaced with mild irritability, as one is when they are forced to go to work with a stomach ache or hangover.
 
The first day is mostly for the characters to be able to use what little information they learned on their first night in Roslyndale so nothing exciting (or inciting) really happens on this day. It's just a normal village, just everyone's a bit more grumpy.
 
### The Second Day
 
The residents look far more gaunt today, as anyone with a passive Perception of 10 and above will be able to tell. Those with a passive Perception of 14 and above will notice random bruises have developed over the townsfolks' bodies, looking further, their eyes are pale and glazed and the ends of their fingers and nose are blue-ish and discolored.
 
They now greet the players with mild hostility, saying things like, "why are you here" and "when will you be leaving."
 
If you decided to use the Research Team, after finishing up with the Kinsley's, a loud scream echos from near the town square where there will be 3 decidedly dead bodies in the center. The townsfolk not only don't notice the bodies, when asked about them, they are genuinely confused about their existence. From the townsfolk's perspective, these bodies do not exist, no matter how thoroughly they are shown.
 
```  
```
 
> ##### Plot Point  
>  
> It's important to keep track of how many days the party spends in the town of Roslyndale. Don't worry too much about what day of the week it is, though, just on what day they are waking.
 
### The Third Day
 
Characters with a passive Perception of 10 and above will notice that the peoples' mouths have tightened to the point where their teeth are showing more, everyone's eyes are fully sunken, their noses are shriveled to the point where you can almost see their nasal cavity. Anyone with a passive Perception of 14 and above notices the resident's skin is so paper thin that their bones and long since dried blood vessels show through. Their nails and teeth appear to have grown unnaturally long as the skin around them has receded completely.
 
The party is now met with open hostility, though the tonsfolk will not yet fight them, with accusations such as, "How dare you diturb our slumber" and "you being here is the Mistress's fault" and "that damned Henry Cotton put you up to this, didn't he?" and "everything was fine until the Cottons arrived."
 
If you decided to include the Research Team, the party finds Mole scavenging in an empty house. The Research Team section will give you more information.
 
### The Fourth Day and Beyond
 
Everyone in the town has gone full rotting classic zombie, more colloquially known in this area as the gravebound, no longer with any intelligence, and will attack any living creature on sight that has stayed in the town for this many days or longer. If the party kills anyone, they rise again the next morning as though nothing happened. These particular gravebound are known as **crawlers** and their stat blocks can be found in the appendices.
 
Some things to note: crawlers are immune to all physical damage not dealt from magical weapons. They are very slow and gather in hordes. As the DM, use the hordes to push the party in the direction of the parts of the storyline that the party members haven't yet been able to crack.
 
### The Fifth Day and Beyond, optional
 
If you want to add a little more urgency and a survival aspect to the storyline, add one or more of the special gravebound from the appendix for every day past the fouth day.

# Mornings
 
As the sun rises, the characters wake up wherever they decided to bed down regardless of where they were when the sun rises having successfully finished a long rest. Any party members that died also wake rested. If the players stayed at the Wandering Flower, Millie likely gave them the big room at the end of the hall. Read one of the following dialogues every morning until day 4 (or 5, depending on if you opted into using that) and beyond when everyone goes full flesh-eater, at which point the Kinsleys attack the party when they arrive at the scene. The scene plays out as any of the characters descend the staircase, approaching the tavern.
 
* Add any items found the previous night to the rumormill section, as these are now considered stolen items and the previous owners of said items are now looking for them.
 
Or  
* With the exception of magic items, which are not subject to the town reset, any treasure that was attained the previous night are no longer in the party's inventory. If a magic item was found in a house or place of business, add the "stolen" magic items to the rumormill section as the previous owners are now looking for them.
 
If the party took the money on the table used to pay for their meals and rooms the previous evening, and has at least one rogue, or otherwise shady PC in the party, read the following box text:  
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Took the money, has a Rogue   As you walk up the hallway, you hear the Kinsley's voices quietly arguing, "maybe it was, Henry, maybe it wasn't. Don't you remember Aranor, the elf thief, in my party?" Millie's voice tries to calm Henry.   "Oh I remember!" Henry retorts, "I rather didn't like him either."   "But he was good at what he did. They're still starting off, we don't need the money, we have plenty more. Let them have this as practice."   You enter the tavern and Millie turns towards you all, "Good morning! How was your night?"  
</div>
 
If the party took the money from the previous evening, but has no rogues, or doesn't have any shady PCs in the party, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Took the money, has no Rogue
 
"No, it wasn't the adventurers. They don't even have a thief in their party," Millie's voice can be heard when approaching the tavern.   "But it's the exact amount those ratcatchers-" Henry retorts   Millie cuts him off, "hush now, you know I don't like that word. Don't forget that I was also an adventurer once."   "That doesn't mean-" She cuts him off again as you arrive in the tavern, "Ah looks like we company! Good morning! How was your night?"  
</div>
 
> ##### Roleplaying the Kinsleys  
>  
> Millie used to be an adventurer and has since retired with her gains in this town with Henry. She has 8 levels in Open Fist Monk. Millie Kinsley is a laid-back, humble soul who doesn't like to be flashy with her wealth and abilities.  
>  
> Henry is far more regular than Millie, who had always been more intrepid than he. The two were engaged to marry far before Millie became an adventurer. In fact, Millie became an adventurer originally to save Henry who was nabbed and held hostage, forced to work tirelessly in the salt mines. After Millie was finally able to rescue Henry, she had some unfinished business with the rest of her party. Henry was very understanding and married her, taking her last name, before she left. He used to call her his Wandering Flower when they were able to spend time together.  
>  
> After the group lost Kairon, they all looked to found a small village and settle down enjoy the rest of their life in relative peace. All was well until the spell failure.  
>  
> Millie's stat block can be found in the appendices. If the party fights her after day 4, add the following features to her stat block: undead fortitude, damage Immunity: poison, condition immunities: poisoned, senses: darkvision 60ft. Henry becomes a normal crawler.
 
If the party left the money on right where it was, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Left the money alone   "Look, I know they haven't done nothing yet, but look at all the mischief you got up to in your ratcatching days." You hear Henry speak as you descend the stairs, his voice sounds concerned.   "Henry, please stop using that word. I truly don't like it. If they cause too much mischief, I'll talk to them." Millie retorts.   "My Wandering Flower, it may be too late when that happens."   "Hush now, I hear someone coming down the hall." She turns towards you as you enter the tavern, "Good morning! How was your night?"

# Mistress Lackman's Final Rewrite
 
As has been previously talked about, the village is cursed to relive its very last day and completely resets every morning. Mistress Lackman visits the market square first then follows the same route every day the characters wake outlined below, eventually finding herself and Mr. Cotton in the third floor laboratory where the spell fails, blasting out the same bluish shock wave and transforms the town into what is seen every night, at about 1:15am. Until then, the night is completely normal.
 
This also means that all monsters (with the exception of any tempus cari and any monsters killed by the tempus cari), and residual hauntings are also reset. I run by milestone leveling, so I don't have to worry about XP farming, but feel free to lessen the difficulty of the monsters they encounter to prevent this.
 
**Should treasure reset???**
 
Before the death of her children, Mistress Lackman enjoyed making an almost daily public appearance in the goings on in the town to boost moral and make people feel welcome and cared for. This closed the gap between the working class and the founders of Roslyndale.
 
Even after the death of her children, she still made an effort to show herself in town, though it was far less frequent. Only a day here and there every week or two. The final day was one of these days. The whole circuit takes the full day from sunrise to sunset and between each destination, she makes frequent stops into many of the shops on the way to ask how business is going.
 
## Gorren's Breakfast
 
Gorren Ramski is the chef of the village and resides in the kitchen section of the Lackman Estate. His goal after retiring from adventuring was to open restaurants across the continent. He may have been able to do it too, had it not been for the tragedy that occured here. He worked in the Lackman Estate kitchen as practice and study.
 
He cooked for the Lackmans, for the servants, and for all of the parties and functions that were held at the estate, from dances and dinner parties, to weddings and funerals. He cook for them all.
 
After her bath, the Mistress started her day in the kitchen eating whatever Gorren prepared for breakfast that day. She like spending time with Gorren and watching him study, learn, and talk about food and ingredients from all across the settled world. She also enjoys hearing of the adventures of the Grove, as he always seems to have a story for each item he prepared. On this day, the time she finishes with Gorren's breakfast is 9am.  
```  
```  
## The Statue in the Fountain
 
In the center of the market square stands a tall statue and fountain. This is a statue of the tiefling, Kairon, one of the members of the grove that had passed away on their last adventure. Kairon is dancing and playing an exquisitely crafted violin. For a description of Kairon, see the appendices. If anyone looks at the statue while under the effects of the *detect magic* spell, it will glow with an aura of transmutation. The violin has grown and changed color to match that of the statue itself and can be dislodged from the statue. This is a **Violin of Building**.
 
After the Mistress is finished with her breakfast with Gorren, she dresses in the same black dress and veil in which the party first met her. She then leaves the estate and walks downtown where she pays her respects to Kairon and leaves a few coins for the dead. This is usually collected by children, or what few homeless are passing through the village.
 
She arrives at the statue around 10am and spends a few hours and coin at the local downtown businesses to share the Lackman wealth and help them stay open.
 
## Mr Marlborough's Bakery - she also eats at the bakery
 
Around 1pm, the Mistress stops into Mr. Marlborough's Bakery in the Market Square as her last stop after visiting the other shops. Pastries and other baked goods are a delightful way to raise moral.
 
This the same encounter that the players first found her. On the first day, I usually have the Mistress enter the bakery as the PCs are approaching the town square. If you do the same, replay through the Arrival section, allowing interuptions this time, if you wish. On following days, the charaters may wish to try to get to the bakery first. If they do this, the shopkeeper doesn't know that the Mistress will visit today. In addition to the knowledge in the rumormill section, the shopkeeper knows that she used to visit his shop, and by extension downtown, ever couple of days. Since losing her children, she's been stricken with grief and doesn't leave the estate too often anymore.
 
**Change this. The Mistress walking downtown after a long absence would probably be big news**
 
If the players inform Mr Marlborough that the Mistress will come by, he will initially be delighted by the thought and ask how they know. They'll likely say something about the time loop, and if they do, he'll laugh it off, yet be shocked that the PCs were able to predict her arrival. If he is hostile, he may even accuse them of being witches and ask them to leave.

## The Prefecture - Write that she drops off sweets here
 
Being a village, Roslyndale doesn't benefit much from a "guard" per se. Their watchmen are merely the men and women of the village that volunteer to be watchers. Everyone is paid a healthy wage for their service to Roslyndale.
 
The prefecture is the watcher station, where the village watch comes to get their routes, bring criminals for judgement, and store weapons. Weapons in this instance is a loose term for what the watchers wield in defense.
 
The Prefecture is run by Aranor Thalis, the thief for the Grove. Aranor is a drow who now goes by the name Mrs. Ilene Pratcher. She has a penchant for keeping things under control.
 
She stops into the prefecture between 3pm and 5pm to talk about local crime numbers and anyone that may be trying to undermine Roslyndale from surrounding underground organizations. If anyone is one of the two jail cells she'll go converse with them as well. If you've opted to include the research team, feel free to put Mole here to be found. He was arrested for any reason you deem relevant. Since he goes by the name Mole, I opted to say he was arrested for questioning as a possible mole. Refer to the Research Team section for what he knows.
 
## The Wandering Flower - drops off remaining sweets except for two.
 
After the Mistress finishes up at the prefecture, she visits the The Wandering Flower Inn and Tavern to grab a small bite to eat and wash it down with a glass of ale. Clever she is in the way she listens. As she talks to Millie, Henry, and the bar patrons, she keeps her ears open behind her for keywords that have to do with the safety of Roslyndale and other interesting village tidbits.
 
Her active conversation often includes what is happening in the surrounding area, important information about the town itself, and asking if there is anything she should be aware of.
 
If the party doesn't leave the tavern all day, they will run into her here around 5, where she enjoys her meal until about 7.
 
```  
```  
## The Cotton Residence - finish chase
 
After finishing up in the tavern, Mistress Lackman heads over to the Cotton residence to talk to Henry about the final preparations before they convene for the ritual at the third floor of her estate.
 
Walking straight here from the tavern should take about ___ minutes, but she walks here in a very round-about path the loops and switches back. This allows her to identify and lose anyone that tries to follow her.
 
If the party does attempt to follow, describe her leaving the tavern and walking towards the main streets of the residential area of the village. She learned these tactics from Aranor. Additionally, the village was planned out by the Grove members, one of whom was Aranor. She knows very well how to design a settlement so that if you know the settlement well, you can utilize it to lose someone tracking you.
 
#### Following the Mistress  
##### Player Checks:  
- Stealth - obvious reason  
- Performance/deception - blending in/act natural  
- Acrobatics/athletics - deal with environmental factors  
##### Mistress counter-moves  
- Reflection check - "perception check. up ahead is a window positioned in a way where someone could see behind them without turning around. What do you do?"  
- Change in direction/pace - The Mistress suddenly slows down or speeds up. Players need to figure out how to keep a safe distance. Additional stealth check.  
- Double Back - have the party roll an insight to notice that her steps imply that she is thinking of suddenly changing her direction. The players have to roll deception/performance checks to quickly blend in when the Mistress turns around.  
- Circular path - have the players make a roll to see if they can recognize that the path the Mistress took is about to become circular and will double back on itself.  
##### Random Encounters  
- Street urchins bumping into the party (perception/insight check to notice that they were pick-pocketed)  
- A guard questioning the party  
- A merchant packing up and moving their stall accidentally moving in the way  
- Road blockage that the Mistress moves through effortlessly. Roll athletics or acrobatics to navigate. Better yet, use this if the party splits off to try and head her off. Maybe a bunch of merchants are leaving to go home. Mistress walks through before traffic gets heavy.  
- Perception check to notice someone watching the characters. Is the person an ally, a foe, or just a red herring?  
##### Detection Meter  
- Each time the detection meter increases, the challenges become more difficult. Maybe weight the die results so the higher end (or lower) is more difficult than the lower...oh, actually! Have the chart be filled with a bunch of stuff, the easier stuff as lower rolls, and the harder stuff as higher rolls. Like rolls higher than the dice can roll. Then each time the meter increases, either add +1 to the roll, or increase the denomination of the die (d4->d6->etc)
   

Roll on the table to determine what tactic she uses.  
##### Evasion Tactics  
|2d4 | Tactic Used |  
|:--:|:---------:|  
| 2 |~ Change of Appearance |  
| 3 |~ Utilizing reflections |

2/8 - escape: Change of appearance, alleyways
 
W/W - counter stays same, PCs on trail  
W/L - counter stays same, PCs lose trail

5 25.00% - W/W  
6 18.75% - Challenge  
7 12.50% - W/L  
8 6.25% - L/L
 
**Using a distraction:** The Mistress walks behind something then uses an amulet to create a simple illusion of her going in a different direction. She waits for a moment to see if anyone follows the illusion before continuing on her way. Do not increase the Identified Counter as she will believe she's successfully lost her persuers.
 
**Slowed pace:** The Mistress slows her pace considerably. The party has 2 rounds to decide how they wish to play off following the Mistress. If they fail to do so, increase the Identified Counter by 1
 
If she feels physically threatened by the PCs, she will not use this tactic for any longer than it takes to identify the group. If this is the case, the players only have 1 round.
 
**Utilizing reflections:** The Mistress passes something reflective that she can use to look behind her.
 
**Double back:** The Mistress crosses the road and starts moving in the opposite direction up the path she originally came down. The characters have one full round while she crosses the street to conceal themselves or otherwise make themselves not appear like they are following her. If they fail to do so, increase the Identified Counter by 1.
 
**Using alleyways:** The Mistress suddenly ducks into an alleyway then quickly turns another corner so anyone following too far away loses her trail, but too close and will be identified.
 
If the PCs are too far away to see her do this, have them make a DC 17 Wisdom (Survival) check to see if they can pick up her trail. If they rush to the corner to get a view of her next turn, have them roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check with disadvantage against her Wisdom (Perception) check. If they fail, increase the Identified Counter.
 
**Sudden stop:** The Mistress stops entirely for a few minutes or so and pretends to think or maybe even look at something. What she is doing is actually looking around her surroundings to identify possible followers. If this is rolled, the party is automatically identified. Increase the identified counter by 1.
 
**Change of appearance:** A small crowd of people walk towards the Mistress, and therefore the party as well. As the crowd passes the Mistress, she activates the amulet to cast *disguise self* then joins the crowd. From the PC's perspective, the crowd envelopes the Mistress and then she vanishes.
 
If this result comes up, the PCs automatically lose the Mistress and must find a way to pick up her trail.
   

#### Identified Counter
 
The path requires a base of 4 checks before she arrives at Mr Cotton's. Every time the party is caught following her, it adds more checks. The first time they are caught, she is unsure if they are following or coincidentally traveling in the same direction. This adds 2 more checks. The second time they are caught, she knows she is being followed, but thinks she can lose them. This adds 4 more checks. The third time they are caught, she realizes she can't shake them and moves quickly towards the closest place of business to wait them out for 30 minutes. The fourth time
 
An argument can be heard from inside the house near the north east corner. If the players press themselves up against a wall of this room, they get advantage on their perception check to hear the conversation. This is the same argument as is in the dream.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
"This is a terrible idea Mistress. Bringing people back is tremendously dangerous!" Calls an elderly man.
 
"I care not for the consequences Mr Cotton. I paid you your price and you will obey. Or do I need to send word to the Sovereign Concordat?" snaps the Mistress in a threatening manner.
 
He acquiesces, "no Mistress, I will complete the ritual."

# Research Team
 
Throughout the years, there have been mysterious disappearances of individuals venturing into Roslyndale. Consequently, those responsible for public safety, constrained by limited resources, have declared the town not only unsuitable for visitors but also perilous. Roslyndale remains obscure to many, primarily due to governmental efforts to conceal its existence. Authorities fear that publicizing a "haunted town" could inadvertently increase its allure.
 
Periodically, small groups manage to secure permits to enter Roslyndale for various purposes, persuading the authorities to grant them access. The key condition attached to these permits is maintaining secrecy about the town's happenings, restricted to those named in the agreement.
 
This scenario recently unfolded for a four-member research team, who gained entry to Roslyndale mere days before the players' arrival. Tragically, three team members fell victim to the gravebound. Their bodies are the ones discovered in the town commons. The lone survivor, a halfling known as Mole, is currently in a state of terror, concealed and struggling to survive while attempting to complete the team's original mission.
 
## Alton Lyle Lindal Merric Gerric Milo Thorngage
 
Or known more simply as Mole, for his deep love of archeology and study of the world's civilizations long since dead and forgotten.
 
### Meeting Mole
 
Feel free to introduce the party to Mole wherever you deem most appropriate. Mole could be introduced, as an example, in the jail cell if the party enters the prefecture. The most important thing to keep in mind is that you don't want to introduce him too early. The players should feel confused and disoriented. The most opportune time to introduce him is when the party has accrued an uncomfortable amount of questions that they are struggling to answer. This will likely happen on the third or fourth day. The following outlines an example of meeting Mole in an empty house.  
```  
```  
#### Empty House
 
Sometime on day three or four, the party may find an empty house. Read the following, the bolded bits are story beats to wait for:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You see a small, dark shape move in the window of one of the houses. What do you do?   **Upon entering the house, [read:**](http://read:**) Entering the house, a series of clatters echo from a nearby table in the next room.   **Upon moving to the next room, [read:**](http://read:**) Upon entering, the aroma of reheated dried provisions fills the air. You look to see a dinner table with a plate of dried meats and vegetables. A fork is carelessly strewn atop the food.  
</div>
 
A DC 11 Wisdom(Perception) check is sufficient to spot Mole, who is huddled fearfully in the corner. When the party discovers him, he unsteadily brandishes a paring knife in their direction, attempting to appear threatening, albeit weakly. With a tone of desperation, he pleads, "Please, just leave me be, I don't want to be devoured!"
 
### Mole's Knowledge Base
 
Mole's unique expertise as an archaeologist specializing in past civilizations can be a goldmine of information for your players, particularly in unraveling the mysteries of Roslyndale and its current plight. Here's an expanded version of Mole's knowledge base, along with a prompt for further adventure:
 
1. **Origin of the Magical Disturbance**:  
- Mole speculates that the disturbance might be linked to a ritual known as "The Veil of Echoes," an ancient practice used to bridge the realm of the living and the dead. This ritual, often depicted in old murals, required a powerful artifact known as the "Eclipsed Amulet," which could channel spirits from the beyond.
 
2. **Historical Accounts of Similar Events**:  
- He recounts tales of the lost city of Arkania, where citizens were once trapped in a loop of time due to a cursed relic. He draws parallels between their fate and the situation in Roslyndale, suggesting a similar curse might be at play.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
3. **Ancient Necromancy Practices**:  
- Mole discusses necromantic rituals of the Zathrian Cult, who believed in binding spirits to physical locations, creating an eternal guardianship. He theorizes that a similar force could be binding the townsfolk's spirits to Roslyndale.
 
4. **Lore of Gravebound Spirits**:  
- He explains that gravebound spirits are often souls tied to unresolved earthly matters. They are known to manifest near their graves or places of death, and certain rituals might release or communicate with them.
 
5. **Cultural Significance of the Undead**:  
- Mole illustrates how different cultures interacted with the undead. In the ancient kingdom of Esteria, for instance, the undead were revered as ancestral protectors and given offerings to maintain peace.
 
6. **Archaeological Evidences in Roslyndale**:  
- He points out the presence of runic symbols on some of the town's oldest buildings, akin to those used in binding spells, suggesting that the town's very architecture might be part of a grand magical construct.
 
### Mole's Personal Request
 
After sharing his knowledge, Mole timidly requests the players' assistance in giving his deceased colleagues a proper burial. He explains his physical limitations in handling the bodies himself. This request serves as a catalyst for the players to explore the graveyard, a location they might not have considered yet.
 
### Push Towards the Graveyard
 
1. **Honoring the Fallen**:  
- He suggests using the "Rite of the Final Passage," an ancient burial ritual that ensures safe passage to the afterlife, preventing the deceased from becoming restless spirits. This rite includes a version of *gentle repose* that non-divine casters can use. It pleads with Queen Milla to watch over the departed.
 
2. **Potential Clues at the Graveyard**:  
- The graveyard may hold ancient gravestones or crypts with inscriptions that reveal more about the town's curse or the origins of the shockwave phenomenon. This should push them in the direction of the Lackman Estate.  
```  
```  
3. **Unearthed Relics**:  
- Mole suspects that artifacts related to the town's curse, possibly items used in the original spell or ritual that caused the disturbance, might be buried alongside the town's founders. This is an instance of an NPC being incorrect, as described below under "Note the the Dungeon Master."
 
4. **Encounter Opportunities**:  
- The graveyard could be guarded by spectral entities or contain traps designed to protect the secrets of the dead. Feel free to add these into the graveyard scene described later in this module.
 
By integrating Mole's academic background into the narrative, you not only enrich the lore of your campaign world but also provide a meaningful way for the players to engage with its history. This encounter with Mole sets the stage for further exploration, discovery, and adventure in Roslyndale.
 
#### Mole as an ally
 
When the party encounters Mole, his key role is to synthesize the various pieces of information they have gathered so far. As an expert in his field, Mole has a unique ability to connect disparate historical and archaeological clues, providing a clearer picture of the situation in Roslyndale. However, it's important to note that Mole does not possess all the answers, particularly regarding the means to aid everyone affected or to break the curse plaguing the town. His expertise is more historical and analytical, rather than magical or curative.
 
Based on the party's progress and exploration thus far, Mole can guide them towards the next critical area of investigation:
 
1. **The Church**: If the party has not yet fully explored the church, Mole suggests this as a potential site for uncovering more clues. He believes that religious sites often hold key historical records or artifacts that could shed light on the town's mysteries.
 
2. **The Cemetery**: Should the party have left the cemetery unexplored, Mole recommends a thorough investigation there. He hypothesizes that the cemetery, being a place of rest for the deceased, might be closely tied to the supernatural occurrences in Roslyndale.
 
3. **The Lackman Estate**: In case the church and the cemetery have been explored, but the party is unaware of the estate's significance, Mole points them in that direction. He speculates that the estate, particularly since it belonged to a historically significant family, could be a critical piece in understanding the town's curse.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
4. **Translating Henry's Journal and Notes**: If the players have discovered Henry's coded journal and notes but are struggling to decipher them, Mole offers his services. He can translate these documents, but he needs a full day to study and interpret the coded language. This challenges the players in a subtle way. Do they risk passing another day and making the gravebound even more angry and even more powerful? Or do they forgo the information held in the journal? **Note for third draft: make sure the journal has significant clues that will make things easier if the party knows, but don't put critical information that the party *needs* to further their goals**
 
Mole's guidance is based on his archaeological perspective and understanding of historical patterns. He directs the party towards places of historical and cultural significance, which he believes are likely to hold the keys to unraveling the mysteries they face. His translations of Henry's journal and notes could also provide pivotal information for the party's quest.
 
#### Note to the Dungeon Master:
 
As the players interact with Mole, the archeologist, it's important to remember that the insights he provides are based on his own research, interpretations, and hypotheses. While Mole is knowledgeable, his understanding of the situation in Roslyndale and the broader historical context is not infallible. His theories, especially regarding the origin of the magical disturbance and the nature of the undead in Roslyndale, are a mix of educated guesses, folklore, and archeological deductions, which he will freely admit while he speaks.
 
Mole's perspective is shaped by his academic background and personal experiences, which means he may inadvertently mix facts with his interpretations or assumptions. This can lead to some inaccuracies or incomplete information. As the DM, you can use this to add layers of mystery and encourage players to explore further and seek additional sources of information. Mole's insights are intended to enrich and advance the players' ongoing investigation, offering clarity and direction based on their discoveries so far, rather than providing conclusive solutions. This approach allows for flexibility in the narrative and gives room for players to make their own discoveries and conclusions as they delve deeper into the mysteries of Roslyndale.
 
By framing Mole's knowledge as subjective and not entirely reliable, you create a dynamic where players are encouraged to actively engage with the world, seek out multiple viewpoints, and piece together the truth from different sources. This adds depth to the adventure and enhances the role-playing experience.

# Important Houses
 
The adventurers are at liberty to explore the entirety of the village of Roslyndale. However, it's important to note that the longer they remain, the more perilous the village becomes. Within the town, several critical locations provide opportunities for the players to unravel the mysteries at hand. This part of the narrative details the discoveries players can make during their nocturnal explorations.
 
To start, a random encounter chart is available for those moments when the party diverges from the expected path, as players often do. In such instances, you should sketch out a simple dwelling, approximately 30 to 45 feet in dimension, complete with basic furnishings like a bed, table, chairs, windows, and a fireplace. Adding a child's bed gives an opportunity for a spectral wisp to emerge from a hidden corpse, appearing at a moment you find suitable.
 
After drawing the house, consult the random encounters chart to determine what, if any, presence occupies the house. The appendices provide examples of Residual Hauntings. For heightened suspense, I prefer to introduce these encounters unexpectedly – for example, when the players lower their guard, during a change in watch, or amidst roleplaying activities. As always, be sure not to interupt during the height of roleplay.
 
The rest of this section delves into significant locations within Roslyndale, aside from the Lackman House, where players can gather clues about the village's current predicament. These key sites include the Farmer's House, the Clergyman's house, and Mr. Cotton's house, each harboring its own secrets and insights into the town's eerie situation.

### Farmer's House
 
If the party follows the child from the end of the tavern scene, they end up here. Read the following upon them entering or peering through a window into the house:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
The first floor interior is in complete disarray. The floor is decayed and splintering. In the corner by the front door is a broken dining table with some chairs around it, one of which is also broken, and a high chair. Looking closer, it almost seems like someone is sitting at the table but your eyes readjust and nothing is there. A case on the left holds a few personal effects of the owners and some toys for an infant. On the back wall are two doors framing a hearth.  
</div>
 
<!--  
80/5=16 1:5| (225-150)/20=4 | 16+4=20  
Should have been 30  
Correction is probably correct  
80/X=26  
X=13:40  
X~1:3  
-->
 
Behind the door to the right is a small pantry with food long since rotted and withered.
 
If anyone inspects the case on the left, they hear sounds of a child cooing as a rattle is heard shaking back and forth.
 
If anyone inspects the hearth, read them the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
Warm smoke rises from the cauldron in the cold hearth as you approach. When you look in to inspect it, the floorboards above you creak under someone's weight as you hear gentle footsteps cross the top floor slowly. A soft, feminine lullaby is heard being hummed. This catches your attention and you look up to see a completely new and vibrant ceiling that is very well taken care of, light from the hearth fire dancing off the crossbeams. When you look back to the hearth, you see the bottom of a cold, dark cauldron, and the humming above ceases.  
</div>
 
When the party decides to go through the door on the left, have them all make a DC10 perception check. Those who decide not to make the check with advantage. Read the following to those that pass:
 
<div class='descriptive'>Those that pass glance back and see a bear of a man with broad shoulders the size of a barn wearing a typical farmer's outfit sitting at the table horrifically stuffing his face, his back towards the party. Food, drink, and slobber spews from his mouth as he gorges himself voraciously. What do you do?  
**Read the following for anyone that move towards the man:**   The man slowly turns his head in your direction, mouth full of rotten food and drink gushing from the bottom of throat. A large glob of saliva forms out of the corner of his gaping maw, chewing mouth wide open, and as it falls to the floor, splattering on impact, the man lunges towards you all.  
</div>
 
Have everyone who moved towards the man make a DC15 Wisdom Saving Throw or be aged 1d8 years, or half as much on a save, modified by the character's ansestry as described in the appendices.
 
Wait for the player's reactions to be finished, and when they are read to move through the door, they do so without further issue and are met with the bottom of an old staircase. As they climb the staircase, make sure to tell them how rickety and unsafe the staircase feels. This will be important later as they are leaving.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
When they reach the top of the landing, they are met with another closed door. The door is unlocked and can be opened with ease. Read the following to any that enter:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You enter the room, moonlight shining through the fog, casting deep, dark shadows throught the space. You see a chamber pot and wash basin along the back wall you're standing by. In the far back corner sits a turning wheel with broken down cotton attached. A side table sits next to a bed in front of you. The sheets and blankets are old and decayed. In the bed rests two leathery corpses, the larger frame on its back and the smaller of the two on its side away from the other. The smaller one's feet are cluching around the closer foot of the larger body.   To the right of the bed is a hooded bassinette in the same condition as the bed. A skirt hangs around the trim obscuring the inside. The cooing of an infant resonates from within the bassinette. What do you do?  
</div>
 
If anyone moves towards the bassinette or trying to attack it at range, Have everyone in the room roll a DC 14 perception check and after they announce their results, roll initiative. Anyone who failed is surprised on the first round. Those who pass, notice that the shadows on the bodies are no longer as dark as they were.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
After defeating the shadows, everyone in the room notices a pulsating blue glow resonating from inside the bassinette.
 
**Anyone that inspects the bassinette** notices a blue flame emerges from what appears to be a leathery doll. The flame bobs gently out of the window and into the house across the way.   **Anyone that looks out the window** sees a small child beckoning to them to follow.  
</div>
 
In truth the blue flame, or Will-o'-Wisp, is traveling towards the Lackman Estate and Mistress Lackman, but being incorporeal, it takes the shortest route instead of traveling around the houses. The house the party sees the wisp move "into" is the Clergy House.
 
A few shelves line the inside of the upper closet. Against the back wall is a shelf with a locked lockbox. The weight of anyone of size medium or larger stepping into the room causes the floor to give way and the character falls to the first floor. Have that character make a DC15 Dexterity Saving Throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
 
If they do manage to get it, the box is old and can be broken into very easily by popping it open with decent leverage. Inside the box is 2d6gp 1d10sp 2d12cp and 2d4gp worth of miscellaneous gemstones.
 
```  
```
 
### Clergyman's House
 
If the players follow the child from the Farmer's House, they'll end up here in the Clergyman's House. The scripts you read to the players outline what should be read if they enter the room and what should be read if the peer through the windows first, as there are windows to each room. If the party didn't look through the windows to each room before entering, read the entering text first, then the peering text, unless otherwise stated.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**Main Room, read the peering text first**   **Peering in,** you see a broken table with four chairs around it, some of which are also broken. Other than that, the room is pretty bare. In addition to the front door, there is a door against the far wall away from the window and two perpendicular doors in the back.
 
**Entering the home,** you smell the savory smell of venison stew being cooked and hear soft, quiet sobbing from the behind door in the back facing you. Three triskelions adorn the walls around the room.  
</div>   <div class='descriptive'>  
**Girl's room and closet**   **Peering through this window,** you see a bed with mounded sheets, as though someone were sleeping under them. From this angle, you are unable to see the head side of the bed. In the opposite corner from the window, next to the door, is a miniaturized house.   **You enter the room** to find your daughter crying quietly on her bed. She is sat with her back up against her headboard and her face in her elbows. She is clutching her favorite burlap doll tightly, which hangs out the side. You try not to smile too visually at the sight of the flopping doll flailing side to side.   You stand in the doorway for a moment, thinking about what you'll say to her before making your way over and sitting down at the foot of her bed facing the window. You calmly drop your hand down and place it on her foot, petting it gently. You sit quietly for a moment until her sobs turn into small whimpers and then finally fades completely.   "Did it happen again?" A deep, baritone voice emanates from your throat. She nods her head slowly, her face still in her elbows. "Would you like for me to speak with her this time?" A moment passes as she ponders an answer. She heaves a heavy sigh and shakes her head slowly.
 
The vision fades and you stand in the doorway of a rickety room.  
</div>
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
The dollhouse is a replica of the Lackman Estate.
 
If anyone checks the closet, there will be the little girl that was outside the farmer's house cowering in the corner. This is the same little girl that could be seen outside of the window of the Inn and Tavern and the second floor of the farmer's house. She looks up, wiping away her tears, points to the shared wall towards the parents room and places a finger to her lips before fading away. A small burlap doll missing an eye button can be found in on the floor after she vanishes.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**Kitchen**   **As you try to look into through the window, make a perception check (DC12),** to those that pass, it's difficult to see in past what was once herbs drying in the window. Now the rot has spread to cover most of the window. You see a hearth in the corner by the door. Across from the hearth is a wash basin and prep area with a barrel next to it.   **Anyone entering** the kitchen makes a Wisdom saving throw **(DC15)**. Upon entering the kitchen, you look up at an enormous woman stirring the cauldron furiously. Your mother looks down at you and snarls an irate, "Get. Out!" You leave the kitchen crying. Those that passed uncover their faces as soon as they pass the threshold disoriented. Those that failed run despondently until you touch the far door. You who failed are shaken (-4) for 10 minutes.  
</div>
 
*Shaken (-n):* A shaken creature suffers a -n penalty to any attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws it makes where n equals the amount given in the parenthesis.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**Parent's Room and Closet**   **Peering into this room,** you see a two person bed with two figures beneath the sheets. Their dry, leathery heads resting on the pillows. A large chest sits at the foot of the bed and there are two doors in the room, one along the back wall, and one to the side of the bed.   **Entering the room,** you hear a man and a woman fighting through the wall to your right. You collapse to your knees and, with your hands clasped on your ears, start sobbing. You try your best to stay quiet because you know bad things will happen if your mother hears you. As soon as your knees touch the ground, the trunk in front of you slams shut, dissipating the vision in an instant.  
</div>
 
Ask for an investigation check(DC14) whenever someone opens the trunk. The first thing anyone will notice when they open the chest is a small burlap doll that is looking and pointing towards the door to the left (the closet door). If anyone moves, or otherwise tries to disturb the doll, its old seams give way and the burlap itself crumbles as it is moved. Under the doll are a few old sets of common clothes that also crumbles if moved. A successful investigation check reveals a false bottom. Removing it uncovers 1d4pp, 10d6gp, 2d8gp worth of gemstones, a healer's kit, a signet ring, candles, an ink pen and a bottle of midnight blue ink, and some blue sealing wax with silver specs.
 
When anyone touches the back door, have everyone roll initiative as a knife flies towards the head of the one that touched it. Roll an attack roll for the **poltergeist** +4 to hit, and deals 2d4 piercing damage.
 
The poltergeist attacks anyone that moves towards the closet door. If anyone touches or picks up the lockbox in the back, the poltergeist immediately uses its reaction to throw three knives at that person (+4 to hit, deals 2d4 piercing damage each). From then on, the poltergeist will only attack whoever is holding the box. If the key is taken out of the box, the poltergeist will prioritize the key over the box. The one who holds this item will continue to be attacked until they drop it, at which point the poltergeist will carry the key back to the box, if it's out, and then carry the box back to the closet.
 
The poltergeist will follow the characters out of the house.
 
### Cotton House, optional
 
This is the Cotton residence where Henry and Eleanor Cotton live. Henry was conscripted by Mistress Lackman to raise her children back from the dead. However, being the low level wizard he was, he didn't have access to any higher level spells like *raise dead* so he had to make do with the tools at his disposal. I label this section optional, because it is very helpful to the players if they visit this house, but not crippling if they don't.
 
He may have actually succeeded if not for the unfortunate grief Mistress Lackman felt for her children. This grief lead her to demand he research a fast solution. The longer he took, the more impatient she became. After a full year of research, proud that he finally created a working prototype of a lower level version of *raise dead*, he made the grave mistake of reporting this advancement before he could test it. She forced him, under threat of revealing him to the authorities, to perform the prototype ritual.
 
The ritual failed spectacularly, causing a blue shock wave to explode outward, extinguishing all life in the town, entrapping the townsfolk's spirits and turning them into the shadows, spectors, and residual hauntings that are seen today. The ritual, targeting children specifically, were all turned to Will-o'-Wisps.
 
The door handle on the right side door is an expired invisibiliy potion.

> ##### From whom was Mr Cotton running?  
>  
> In my setting, sorcerer's are actively hunted and slain by what are known as witch hunters in the employ of the Sovereign Concordat, a massive, worldwide alliance between the human rulers of the world. Being a sorcerer himself, he sought refuge with an old friend.  
>  
> In your world, from whom was Mr. Cotton running?
 
#### Cotton Study  
In the study can be found books and coded notes on the creation of Cotton's Soul Retrieval, as he named the working title of the prototype. The party can also find his personal journal, which is also coded using the same cipher as his notes, detailing his life when first arriving in Roslyndale right up to the night of the incident. Each entry includes a time marker of when the entry was made, feel free to change these markers to better suit your setting, or leave them as is for ease of reading.
 
#### Entry 1: Foreboding Arrival  
"Upon this morn, I find myself treading the cobbled paths of Roslyndale, a world apart from the turbulent life I left behind. Mr. Heward Lackman, a beacon from days long past, has granted me sanctuary in these desperate times. His assurance of safety within this idyllic village offers some solace, yet a shadow of unease looms within me. I am keenly aware of the perils my presence could bring, for the relentless pursuit of those who hunt my kind knows no bounds. Each exchange with the villagers, while cordial on the surface, is tinged with the silent dread of a truth that lurks within me – a secret that, if exposed, could shatter this semblance of peace."
 
#### Entry 2: A Delicate Masquerade  
"Amid the rustic charm of Roslyndale, I navigate a delicate masquerade. Each day, as I mingle with its folk, I am reminded of the precarious nature of my situation. The fear of discovery lingers like a ghost at my shoulder, casting a subtle pall over the daily pleasantries. The villagers, with their guileless smiles and easy laughter, remain blissfully unaware of the storm that brews beneath my calm exterior. In their presence, I find both solace and sorrow, for hidden beneath my guise as a mere practitioner of the arcane is a truth far more perilous – a nature that, if revealed, could unleash a maelstrom upon this unsuspecting haven."
 
```  
```  
#### Entry 3: Meeting the Lackman Family  
"This day, I was graced with an introduction to the Lackman family, a household embodying the warmth and spirit of Roslyndale. Mrs. Lackman, a figure of dignified poise, and her children, effervescent with youthful exuberance, welcomed me into their fold with open arms. The hearth of their home radiated a comfort and normalcy I had not felt in many a moon. Yet, amidst their laughter and kind words, a sense of guardedness took root within me. In the depths of their unsuspecting eyes, I glimpsed the potential for ruin should the truth of my sorcerous nature come to light. Thus, I donned an unseen mask, playing the part of the humble wizard, all the while cognizant of the perilous tightrope I walk – a man harboring a secret that, if unveiled, could unravel the very fabric of the peaceful life the Lackmans hold dear. I do earnestly aspire that in Heward's absence, my actions shall not give rise to undue commotion or disquietude."
 
#### Entry 4: The Eyes of Innocence  
"Under the watchful gaze of young Silifrey, I have come to realize the depth of her perceptive abilities. Her innocent curiosity, unmarred by the prejudices of the world beyond, must see through the facade I so meticulously uphold. Each interaction with her is akin to a dance, one where I must artfully sidestep her probing questions and keen observations. Her intuition, though not yet fully understood by her youthful mind, poses a risk I had not anticipated. It is in the unguarded moments, the fleeting glances, where I see her puzzling over the inconsistencies in my story. I must tread carefully, for the insight of a child, and this one in particular, unfiltered and pure, could unwittingly unravel the tapestry of secrecy I have woven around myself."
 
#### Entry 5: Suspicions and Unspoken Truths  
"Recent days have brought a subtle yet unmistakable shift in the air, particularly in my interactions with Mrs. Lackman. Her demeanor, once reflective of simple cordiality and blissful ignorance of my true nature, now carries a hint of guarded understanding. I cannot help but suspect that young Silifrey, in her innocence, may have unwittingly revealed my secret. The child, endowed with a keen intuition and, I surmise, a measure of telepathic ability, yet unaware of the gravity of such a revelation, could not have comprehended the peril it brings. Thus, I find myself in a delicate dance of uncertainty and suspicion, wondering if the Mistress truly knows of my sorcerous lineage. No words have been exchanged on the matter, yet in every silent acknowledgment, in every measured conversation, I sense the truth lurking just beneath the surface. The burden of this unconfirmed knowledge weighs heavily upon me, casting a shadow over the fragile sanctuary I have found in Roslyndale."
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
#### Entry 6: A Close Call and Silent Accord  
"Today, the shadows I've long feared crept into Roslyndale. An agent of the Sovereign Concordat, a witch hunter, arrived under the guise of mundane inquiries, seeking a suspected sorcerer. My heart raced as our paths crossed; his piercing gaze, like a hawk's, seemed to see through my every defense. The encounter was a razor's edge from disaster, but fate, it seems, had other plans.
 
Just as the witch hunter's suspicions neared confirmation, Mrs. Lackman intervened, her timing as fortuitous as it was unexpected. With an air of casualness belying the gravity of the situation, she engaged the agent, her words weaving a protective shroud around my precarious position. Her deft conversation steered his suspicions astray, allowing me to remain concealed in plain sight.
 
During this heart-stopping exchange, an astonishing revelation unfolded. I discerned that Heward had foreseen such a perilous eventuality. In his wisdom and foresight, he had ensconced powerful wards around me, designed to obfuscate my true nature. These wards, unbeknownst to me, had been my silent guardians, shielding me from the prying senses of the witch hunter.
 
The Mistress, through her subtle cues and veiled glances during the conversation, revealed her awareness of my sorcerous identity. Yet, in her actions, she extended an unspoken assurance of sanctuary. This silent accord between us, born amidst the clutches of danger, has bound our fates in a complex weave of secrecy and mutual reliance. The realization that both Heward and now the Mistress have chosen to protect me leaves me in a state of profound gratitude and deepening resolve. And perchance, a degree of indebtedness has been sown. Indeed, let us earnestly hope that no consequences shall arise from this unintended seed."
 
#### Entry 7: Rising Illness and Unveiled Ties  
"As a subtle ailment begins to weave its way through Roslyndale, concern mounts among the townsfolk. Today, Millie Kinsley, the innkeeper of The Wandering Flower, approached me with a mixture of worry and hope in her eyes. She implored me to use whatever magic I might possess to understand and possibly curb this burgeoning sickness. 'You may not be a healer, but perhaps your magic can offer some insight,' she said, her words betraying her knowledge of my true identity as a sorcerer in hiding.
 
This acknowledgment of my sorcerous nature initially struck a chord of fear within me. However, this fear was soon alleviated when I discerned the underlying implication in her words – that her knowledge of my true identity as a sorcerer predated even my arrival in Roslyndale. This revelation was not met with fear or hostility, but rather with a quiet trust, a testament to the unexpected and deep bond I have unwittingly formed with the people of this town. In our conversation, Millie also revealed to me a fascinating aspect of the town's history. Heward, my benefactor, was once a member of the storied adventuring group known as the Grove. Alongside him were Gorren Ramski, the village chef known for his hearty meals and warm heart; Aranor Thalis, the steadfast jailor with a keen sense of justice; and Kairon, a figure of valor and sacrifice, memorialized by the statue in the town's fountain.
 
This revelation of Heward's and his companions' past adventures adds a rich tapestry to the backdrop of Roslyndale. It paints a picture of a town woven together by the legacies of its heroes, both celebrated and unsung.
 
Compelled by Millie's request and moved by the trust she and others have placed in me, I resolved to do what I can. As I walked among the ailing, I felt a deep connection to this place that has become my refuge. The magic I possess, though not of the healing kind, may yet offer some insight into this mysterious illness.
 
Today has deepened my sense of belonging in Roslyndale, intertwining my fate with its residents. The intricate web of trust, secrets, and heroic pasts binds me ever more to the destiny of this town, urging me to stand with its people in their hour of need."
 
#### Entry 8: Grief and the Plague's Grip  
"Today, a pall of despair has fallen over Roslyndale, further darkened by news that the Lackman children, Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn, have succumbed to the mysterious illness afflicting our town. Witnessing Westra enveloped in such profound worry and fear has deeply moved me. I offered what words of comfort I could, but they seemed woefully inadequate in the face of a mother's distress. This turn of events has intensified my commitment to finding some form of treatment or relief.
 
Amidst this growing crisis, word has finally reached Roslyndale that the Bailen Council has issued a state of emergency in response to the plague. Their dispatches claim that this illness is resistant to traditional magical healing, a disheartening revelation that sheds light on why my previous attempts have been ineffective. The council’s reports speak of the ailment's stubborn resistance to the spells and incantations practiced by conventional mages.
 
Despite this daunting challenge, I find myself clinging to a ray of hope. My magic, intrinsic in nature and a part of my very essence, stands apart from the magic of study and invocation. I hold onto the belief that this unique aspect of my sorcery might just provide a critical edge against the illness’s resistance. It's a thin strand of hope, but in times as dire as these, even the thinnest strand can be a lifeline. With a renewed sense of purpose, I continue my research and experiments, seeking any means by which my innate connection to the arcane might offer a glimmer of hope against this relentless malady."
 
DM Note: This is the first time he has called her by her first name, Westra, instead of the Mistress. This implies a measure of familiarity Henry has gained with the Lackmans.
 
#### Entry 9: A Turn of Tides and Deepening Concerns  
"As the days pass in Roslyndale, the town witnesses a bittersweet divide in the fates of those afflicted by the illness. For many, the tides of sickness are receding, bringing with them the first signs of recovery and a cautious breath of relief. Yet, for others, the situation grows increasingly dire, with their conditions deteriorating at an alarming rate. Among these unfortunate souls are the Lackman children, whose worsening state casts a deepening shadow over the heart of Westra and the entire town.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
In this critical hour, I find myself stretched to my limits, offering what aid and comfort I can, though it feels akin to stemming a tide with mere handfuls of sand. My every waking moment is spent in relentless research and experimentation, seeking any strand of hope or hidden knowledge that might halt this descent into despair. The grim reality, however, is that my efforts may not suffice to bring them back from the brink. This thought haunts my every step, a specter whispering of impending loss and failure.
 
Despite these growing fears, I refuse to yield to despair. Each trial, each setback in my studies, serves only to steel my resolve. Yet, beneath this determined exterior, there lurks a gnawing concern – the possibility that my abilities, though considerable, might fall short in the face of this insidious malady. The prospect of failing the Lackman children, and by extension, Westra, weighs heavily upon me, a burden that grows with each passing hour of their continued decline."
 
#### Entry 10: Shadows of Grief and a Fracturing Mind  
"The specter of death continues its grim march through Roslyndale, each day marked by the loss of another soul succumbed to the relentless clutch of the illness. The town, once a haven of tranquility, now reels under the weight of these successive tragedies. Amidst this cascade of sorrow, the most heartrending blow was dealt – the passing of the Lackman children. First, we lost young Kethra, her light extinguishing too soon. Then, Branlyn followed, his youthful resilience faltering. And lastly, Silifrey, whose keen insight and innocence had once unwittingly revealed my secret, joined her siblings in eternal rest.
 
In the time I have spent in Roslyndale, I had come to regard these children with a fondness akin to that of a father. Their loss is a wound to my own soul, a grief so profound that under normal circumstances, it would keep me from the solace of my journal. Yet, tonight, I write, compelled by a pressing need to document a troubling change I have observed in Westra. Her sanity, it seems, is fraying at the edges, the fabric of her mind torn apart by the unbearable loss of her children.
 
There is a coldness in her gaze now when she looks upon me, a bitter accusation unspoken but palpably felt. Her words, once warm and kind, are now edged with a frost that chills me to the bone. I sense her blame directed towards me, as if my failure to save her children is a sin for which I must atone. The path ahead is murky, and I fear where it might lead. I find myself writing these words not just as a record of events, but as a premonition of darker days to come. I am uncertain of the path this situation is taking us down, yet I harbor a strong intuition that its end will not be to my liking. The foreboding that taints these words is a storm cloud on my horizon, and I brace myself for the tempest it portends."  
```  
```  
#### Entry 11: A Fateful Conversation and a Dangerous Promise  
"Tonight, within the dimly lit confines of The Wandering Flower tavern, Westra and I found ourselves sharing a drink, united in our grief. The tavern's usual bustle seemed a world away as we reminisced about her children, their laughter and their antics that once filled the Lackman household with joy. Our conversation, meandering through the valleys of memory, unexpectedly veered into the realm of the arcane. The topics ebbed and flowed, touching upon the mysteries of life and death.
 
In a moment marred by the haze of sorrow and wine, I made a tangential remark that one could, in theory, bring back the departed. Westra, her interest piqued, pressed me for details. My tongue, loosened by inebriation, let slip a second, more perilous thought – that given time and resources, I might find a way to perform such a resurrection, despite the inherent dangers. It was more of a theoretical musing than a serious proposition, but to Westra, my words were a beacon of hope in her sea of despair.
 
Sensing an opportunity, she offered me access to not only the Lackman Public Library but also to Heward's private collection of arcane knowledge. My heart leaped at the prospect. Heward Lackman, a man whose prowess in the magical arts I had long admired from afar, had accumulated a wealth of knowledge that could prove invaluable. In my excitement, I failed to see the potential pitfalls of this path. 'Absolutely!' I exclaimed, blinded by my own hubris – a failing that my dear late Lily would affirm has frequently been my downfall.
 
As our conversation drew to a close, I suggested that the local priest cast a spell called 'gentle repose' on her children's bodies every ten days to preserve them. This would buy me time to delve into Heward's research and develop a safe and effective ritual. A part of me trembled at the magnitude of what I was undertaking. What started as a shared moment of mourning had spiraled into a commitment fraught with uncertainty and danger. As I left the tavern, the weight of our conversation and the promise I had made hung heavily upon me, a chain of hope and dread that I had unwittingly shackled myself with."
 
#### Entry 12: The Burden of Expectations and Inherent Limitations  
"Six months have elapsed since I last penned my thoughts in this journal. The task I have undertaken, to resurrect the Lackman children, has consumed every waking moment, leaving no room for personal reflections. Westra's presence has become a constant in my life, her urgency a tide that ebbs and flows with my progress – or lack thereof. Each time she inquires about the ritual, my response remains the same: 'Magic does not work swiftly.' This seems to pacify her impatience, but I sense it is a temporary reprieve.

The hurdles before me are daunting. The first is the sheer magnitude of the magic required for such a feat. The spells and rituals necessary to bring back the dead are far beyond my current capabilities. I am like a novice attempting to scale a peak that only the most seasoned of climbers could conquer. I delve into Heward's tomes and scrolls, seeking any hint or secret that could elevate my abilities to the required level, but the path is steep and fraught with uncertainty.
 
The second, and perhaps more insurmountable challenge, lies in the very nature of my sorcery. My innate magical abilities, derived from a source unique to my being, do not naturally align with the type of magic required for resurrection. It is akin to a cleric endeavoring to decipher the complex incantations of a high wizard – the knowledge is not only foreign but seemingly inaccessible. I am venturing into uncharted territory, seeking to harness and adapt powers that, by all accounts, should be beyond my reach.
 
The risk of catastrophic spell failure looms over this endeavor like a dark cloud. If I do not find a way to overcome both my limitations and the constraints of my intrinsic magic, the consequences could be dire. This knowledge weighs heavily on my mind, a constant reminder of the delicate balance I must strike between the fervent hope of a grieving mother and the cold, unyielding laws of magic."
 
#### Entry 13: On the Cusp of Discovery and Growing Fears  
"A full season has passed since my last entry, and the winds of change have brought with them a glimmer of hope in my daunting quest. My studies in human anatomy and physiology have borne fruit; I now possess a detailed understanding of the bodily organs and their myriad functions. This knowledge is a crucial piece in the intricate puzzle I am attempting to solve. My current endeavor is to find an animal that has succumbed to the same malady that took the villagers and the Lackman children. If I can procure such a specimen, it may allow me to reverse-engineer the disease, bringing me one step closer to the resurrection I seek.
 
For the moment, Westra has granted me a semblance of space, a respite that is both surprising and welcome. However, I am under no illusion that this reprieve will be lasting. Her patience, though momentarily stayed, is like a candle burning at both ends, and I fear it will not be long before her demands for progress resume with renewed fervor.
 
As the days pass, it becomes increasingly evident that Westra's sanity is unraveling, a thread slowly pulled loose by grief and desperation. With each unraveling strand, a piece of her humanity seems to fade into the shadows. The transformation is subtle yet unmistakable, and it fills me with a sense of foreboding. I find myself increasingly apprehensive about the lengths to which she may go in the coming days. Her descent into madness is a journey I am powerless to halt, and I fear what desperate measures she might resort to as her grip on reality continues to weaken.
 
In this time of tentative progress and uneasy calm, I am acutely aware of the delicate balance I must maintain. The task before me is monumental, not merely in its technical complexity but in its potential repercussions on Westra's fragile state of mind. As I continue my research, the shadow of her looming instability is ever-present, a dark cloud over what should be a time of focused study and hopeful exploration."
 
#### Entry 14: A Breakthrough in the Midst of Despair  
"Another season has turned its page in Roslyndale, bringing with it both despair and a flicker of hope. Approximately a month after my last entry, fortune, or perhaps fate, led me to a cat afflicted with the very malady that claimed the Lackman children. With a sense of urgency, I embarked upon a meticulous study of the creature in its final hours, documenting each symptom and change with painstaking detail. My observations continued unabated as the poor beast succumbed to the illness, marking the beginning of a more intensive phase of experimentation.
 
In the months that followed, the small, lifeless form of the cat became the focus of my relentless efforts. Employing the spell of 'gentle repose' to preserve its body, I delved into the depths of my arcane knowledge, seeking to undo the ravages wrought by the disease. It was a task that consumed me, my every waking moment dedicated to reversing the effects of this insidious affliction.
 
Then, in a moment that I can only describe as a triumph against the shadows of despair, the cat's tail twitched of its own accord. That singular, independent movement was a beacon in the darkness, a sign that I was indeed moving in the right direction. The breakthrough filled me with a surge of hope and determination, a much-needed balm to the weary soul.
 
Now, on the cusp of stabilizing the spell, I stand at the threshold of a new and daunting phase: human testing. The knowledge that I am nearing the point where I can attempt to apply this magic to the Lackman children is both exhilarating and terrifying. The path ahead is fraught with unknowns, but the possibility of restoring life where it was once extinguished propels me forward.
 
As I prepare for this next crucial step, I am mindful of the immense responsibility that rests upon my shoulders. The success of this endeavor could mean the difference between eternal grief and miraculous reunion for Westra. Yet, the weight of this responsibility is tempered by the knowledge that with each passing day, her grasp on reality further loosens, adding an urgency to my work that cannot be ignored. In the quiet moments, I ponder the consequences of failure, not only in terms of the arcane but also in what it might mean for Westra's already fragile state of mind."

#### Entry 15: A Precipice of Hope and Ethical Dilemmas  
"Less than a month has passed since my last entry, and in this brief span of time, my research has taken an unexpected leap forward. The spell, initially unstable and unpredictable in its effects on animals, has begun to exhibit a remarkable adaptability across various species. From the smallest of birds to the cold-blooded reptiles, the magic seems to almost stabilize itself, bending and weaving through the intricate tapestry of life in ways I had not anticipated.
 
With this newfound stability in animal subjects, I stand on the brink of venturing into human trials. The prospect fills me with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. However, in a moment of unbridled enthusiasm and, I must confess, a touch of hubris, I revealed to Westra that I have developed a working prototype. The reaction in her eyes was akin to a dying flame suddenly rekindled - a mixture of hope and a burning intensity that I had not seen in her for some time.
 
Her reaction, while initially heartening, quickly turned to a pressure I was not prepared for. She urged me to use the prototype immediately, her desperation palpable. Fortunately, I managed to convince her of the significant risks still associated with using this spell on humans. The likelihood of catastrophic failure remains high, a fact that, for the moment, has stayed her insistence.
 
As the illness continues its grim hold on the children of Roslyndale, I am painfully aware that I will not lack for test subjects. This thought alone is a horrifying reflection of the person I have become in the midst of this crisis. To view these ailing children as mere subjects for my arcane experiments is a stark deviation from the man I once was. This realization casts a shadow over my soul, a darkness that seems to grow with each passing day.
 
I end this entry with a heavy heart and a mind burdened by ethical quandaries. The path I walk is fraught with moral peril, each step a reminder of the fine line between salvation and damnation. I long for the day when this nightmare is over, when the weight of these decisions is lifted from my shoulders, and the children of Roslyndale can once again embrace the light of life."
 
#### Entry 16: Desperation and Ultimatums  
"Another season has passed in Roslyndale, and with it, the last vestiges of Westra's patience have evaporated. In a confrontation that still leaves my hands trembling as I write, she declared her ultimatum with a cold, steely resolve. No longer willing to wait, she threatened to expose my true identity to the Sovereign Concordat. The mere thought of falling into the hands of the Concordat, who would undoubtedly have their own form of justice for a rogue sorcerer like myself, sends chills down my spine.
 
Her threat was cunningly crafted, leaving her the role of the innocent victim, an unsuspecting villager who had unwittingly harbored a sorcerer. The realization of her willingness to sacrifice me to save herself was both enraging and disheartening. It served as a stark reminder of how desperation can twist even the most kind-hearted souls into unrecognizable forms.
 
It has been only a month and a half since I achieved partial stabilization of the prototype ritual. My progress, while significant in the realm of animal resurrection, pales in comparison to the complexities of human life. The simple anatomies of animals are far easier to mend with magic than the intricate tapestry of the human body. Though I can now bring back animals without immediately destroying their bodies, the leap to human resurrection remains a daunting chasm.
 
The experiments have been grueling, with some successes overshadowed by harrowing failures. There have been instances where the bodies were not just left lifeless but were catastrophically eviscerated by the unstable forces at play. The horror of these failures weighs heavily on me, a constant reminder of the perilous nature of this endeavor.
 
Westra's impatience and her chilling ultimatum have added a layer of urgency and fear to my work. The knowledge that any further delay could result in my exposure to the Concordat, coupled with the still-unsolved complexities of human resurrection, has left me in a state of heightened anxiety. The stakes have never been higher, and the path forward never more fraught with peril. As I close this entry, I cannot help but feel trapped in a relentless cycle of desperation and danger, with each experiment a race against time and the looming threat of betrayal."
 
#### Entry 17: The Final Gamble  
"Ten days have passed since the ultimatum, and tonight marks the culmination of all my efforts and fears. Westra came to me this evening, her resolve hardened, brandishing papers meticulously prepared to deliver me into the hands of the Concordat. The documents were crafted with chilling precision, absolving her of any complicity in harboring a sorcerer. The cold finality in her eyes as she presented them left no room for doubt – she is resolute in her decision.
 
In these desperate hours, however, a glimmer of hope has emerged. I have managed to further stabilize the prototype, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic failure. The progress brings a measure of relief, albeit a small one, in the face of the daunting task ahead. The odds are still perilously stacked against us, but the prospect of success, however slim, offers a faint beacon of hope in this darkest of nights.
 
We have agreed to commence the ritual an hour past midnight. The stillness of the late hour, I hope, will lend an added layer of concentration and focus required for such a delicate and dangerous endeavor. My hands are steady, but my heart is a tumult of anxiety and anticipation. The weight of this moment, the culmination of many seasons of toil, fear, and ethical quandaries, rests heavily upon my shoulders.
 
As I pen this final entry, the reality of what I am about to undertake sets in. This is more than a mere test of my magical abilities; it is a gamble with the highest stakes imaginable. The lives of the Lackman children, my own fate, and perhaps the very soul of Roslyndale hang in the balance.
 
I ask for no divine intervention, nor do I expect any. But if there is any fortune left in this world for a man who has walked the line between life and death, let it find me tonight. Wish me luck."

# Church of Aelus, God of Agriculture
 
Aelus, the God who gifted Agriculture to mortals, has long been reveered as the savior of thinking creatures, especially the humans in this region of the world. This church is dedicated to his benevolence. The door to the shack is blocked from the otherside and, even though the door can be picked, it cannot be opened. The only other doors that cannot be entered are any of the door that lead to the Sanctuary. Any of these doors can only be opened with the key found in the Clergyman's house. No matter which door is walked through, the characters enter the Sanctuary through the front double doors. In which case, read the Sanctuary Scene.
 
The room to the left of the alter room is the pastor's room, if the characters enter this room, jump to the Pastor's Room scene. The room to the right is the extra room. Not much happens in there, though.  
```  
```  
#### Santuary
 
The santuary door can only be opened with the key found in the clergyman's house. Regardless of the stage of decay the townsfolk are in, everyone in the following scene is alive and well. When the party enters, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Sanctuary Scene  
**Start from here anytime the players have not unlocked the door**   You come to a large, elegantly carved door. Contrary to the surroundings, this door is as bright and new as the day it was finished and installed.   You place the key you found into the lock and it turns freely and the door opens into the church's spacious sanctuary.   **Start from here anytime after the first time the PCs have unlocked the double doors for that evening**   As you walk through the large double doors, you see an elegant arrangement of marble columns and granite surfaces. The walls are outlined with a fine golden trim, inlaid stairs are to your left and right inlaid with expensive woods, and cherrywood pews line the atrium up to a raised dais framed in by a low white ash wood fence and upon the dais sits an alter in the middle and a lectern on the left and right sides. Above the dais is a stone depression of Aelus, the God of Agriculture. There are two doors along the back wall to each side of the raised platform.   **Allanon, you smell a faint smell of ozone** as a woman approaches you all, "how kind of you to join us for the funeral during this time of morning. Come, come, sit with me and my husband. Are you friends of Mistress Lackman?"  
</div>   Pause here for a few minutes to give the players some time to talk to Eleanor Cotton. When roleplaying her, know that this is merely just a memory of when she was alive. She was a sweet, pious lady in her mid 50's married to Henry Cotton, the man who Mistress Lackman conscribed to bring her children back to life. Eleanor is not privy to the details of what Henry is doing to help the Lackmans, and she doesn't suspect adultery like the other townsfolk. Her altruistic motivation is simple in this memory, as it was in life: help others when needed, and help everyone who lost someone to the plague through the grieving process of these hard times. She knows everything under the rumormill section.   \page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
When the conversation starts to come to a close, or goes in circles, read the following box text to the players:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
After you finish talking, she leads you over to one of the pews where a man sits near the middle. "Henry, dear," she says to the man quietly as he stares solemnly towards the woman in black, not acknowledging the woman. "These are friends of the Lackman family **she lists off their names**, was it? They've come to pay their respects."   The pastor continues his speech as you look around and see a few other villagers. Off to your left is a giant bear of a man who sits a little ways away from you next to a smaller, more delicate woman holding an infant. You see to your right a bigger woman, her scouling face looks like the woman in the kitchen of the house in which you found the key. A little girl sits next to her. What do you do?  
</div>
 
If anyone asks for an insight check (DC10), it will reveal the girl is leaning away from the woman suggesting she is afraid.
 
After the scene plays out to its entirety, the party members are free to do whatever they wish.
 
#### Alter room  
The two doors along the back wall behind the dais lead to the decidedly run down section of the alter room. Read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Alter Room Scene   The new, fresh veneer of the sanctuary quickly turns cold as you step into this room. There is a door just beside you and another across the room. Four pillars frame a long table in the center just in front of you with two goblets are at each end and three plates run between them. One of the plates is smashed and the tapestry that ran the table under the dishware is old and rotted, with giant holes in it.   There is a massive statue in the back of the room high up on a dais, behind it a large, shattered stained glass scenery depicting fields of corn. Four other stained glass depictions suround the room and there are two brazers to the left and right of the statue. One of which, the left one, has crumpled with rust. There are two steps down behind the table pillars to a lowered area. A thick, heavy rope hangs from the tall ceiling, the bottom of which a few feet from the floor.  
</div>
 
Not much happens in this area. There is some rotten food on the plates and some long since dried wine in the goblets. The doors along the wall are unlocked. If the party goes through the door on the left, jump to the Pastor's Room Scene. If the party goes through the door on the right, jump to the Extra Room Scene. The doors to the exterior are locked and sealed until after they finish the bell tower scene.
 
When the party walks back through the doors to the sanctuary, the characters walk through the double doors of the front entrance. Reread the Sanctuary Scene box text as closely as you can to the first way you read it.
 
```  
```  
#### Second Floor
 
In the sanctuary are two staircases on the left and right of the main double doors leading to the second floor. The unconnected landings on either side look down over the sanctuary. This floor has three pairs of stained glass depictions detailing different scenes of agriculture. Towards the front by the entrance is a large, round topped, double wide stained glass depiction of Aelus giving tools and the gift of agriculture to mortals. Two smaller stained glass scenes frame the larger one portraying the first seeds being sewn into the ground.
 
When the party walks through one of the second floor doors, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Second Floor Scene
 
You walk into the room, There are two long, shallow tables along the back wall framing a ladder going up. Some dishware sits in the far left corner of that table and on the right is an ale cask with cups around it. A small container sits to the right of the cask with a book on top. Smaller, round stained glass scenes surround this room. There are two bookcases, one along the right wall, and one along the front wall by the door on the right. Next to the book case is a coffee table with a couch along the wall and three more comfortable chairs around it. The couch has soot in the vague shape of a humanoid lying across it. Ten chairs sit around a long table old and falling apart. Three of the chairs are also black with soot in vague humanoid shapes.   Two dark ghostly figures float about in this chamber, one in the back left corner, and one by the couch. They seem to be searching for something. As the one reaches towards the couch, it looks at you entering and gives a violent shreek as it lunges towards you. Roll Initiative.  
</div>
 
Roll initiative for the tutelae and four shadows. The four shadows, who were hiding on the couch and chairs act on round 2, leaving their space to focus on the tutelae first, before turning towards the party.
 
After the fight, there is a cacophonous boom from the floor above as a large dolorous churchbell gongs strongly. A large rope can be found in the corner of the room bobbing up and down threaded from the ceiling through the floor.
 
When the party walks back through the doors they entered to get into this room, the characters walk through the double doors of the front entrance. Reread the Sanctuary Scene box text as closely as you can to the first way you read it.   \page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
#### Bell Tower
 
When the party climbs the ladder to the floor above, read the following box text when they all have arrived:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Bell Tower Scene   Entering the trap door above the second floor, the first thing you see is a large bell hanging centered at the top, the bottom a couple feet above the floor. Connected to it is a thick, heavy rope that hangs down threaded into the floor to the room below.   Around the square room, you see four tall, glassless windows out of which the sound eminates. Out of the eastern window floats gently what looks to be an ethereal jellyfish rising and sinking serenly in the air.  
</div>
 
If anyone pulls the rope, the bell swings side to side, getting higher and higher, until the clapper strikes one side releasing a mighty gong. The bell swings to the other side and the clapper strikes to release a second gong. This continues for as long as the characters keep the momentum. Once they stop, the bell will sound one extra time before the swing is not strong enough to complete another. Anyone in the bell tower when the bell tolls makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for the next minute.
 
If the party rings the bell, the jellyfish moves towards the characters, traveling through the ceiling to get to the one that looks the squishiest, where it makes a tendril attack on one of the characters. Describe the attack as it gently encompassing the target's body. If the attack misses, it just sits there around the creature. If it hits, the pain similar to being bit by a potent jellyfish in the ocean, the target's muscles convulsing and withering as it takes 2d8+4 necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6. **Remember: dybbuks are intelligent creatures (Int score of 16). So it can likely figure out which character has the lowest AC.** After dealing this damage once, or being damaged itself, it will vanish in a puff of purple smoke as it casts dimension door on itself.
 
Children can be heard playing on the ground after the dybbuk vanishes. Peering over the side, there are three running around playing a game. A sourceless voice calls to them sounding distressed, "come children, quickly before those creatures return! Quit playing around!" the voice calls desparately. A successful perception check (DC 11) tells the characters that the sourcless voice calls from the shack.
 
If this is still the first night from the Arrival, I'd recommend having the sun rise and rubberbanding the characters back to the Wandering Flower and starting the second day.
 
When the party climbs back down the ladder and walks through either of the doors on the second floor, the characters walk through the double doors of the front entrance. Reread the Sanctuary Scene box text as closely as you can to the first way you read it.  
```  
```  
#### Pastor's Room
 
If the party attempts to follow the voice, they may end up in the pastor's room connected to the left side of the alter room. The outside door to this area is now unlocked. If they do choose this room, read the following box text to the players:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Pastor's Room Scene   A man in vestiges writes fervently at a desk in the near corner by the door. He doesn't seem to notice your entry. There's a bed to your left and a shelf holding some personal affects. Along the back wall is a low cabinet to the left of a door and a bookcase to the right, next to the man at the desk.   **As you walk foward,** his whole body whirls around and his eyes glare deeply into yours as you feel a chill flashes down you spine. You blink and he is gone for an instant before grabbing your arms from behind and spins you around staring intently into what seems like your soul, "Evil Infests This Godly Town!" His voice booms with multiple coinciding tones, like three people speaking at once. You take **1d10** necrotic damage as you feel his cold hand chill you to your bones. You look down in a panic as you feel your muscles wither aging you **1d6** years. You back up from fright and he is gone. You can still feel his grip on your arm and you look down to see a burn in the shape of a hand print.  
</div>
 
Everything in this room is rotted. If anything is handled, it crumples and falls apart.
 
#### Extra Room
 
This room is pretty inconsequential. This is a resting quarters for guests and the weary. It has two beds, some night stands, and a table on the opposite side with some dishware. Feel free to put something here if you wish. In my run, I wanted one thing to be not dangerous, just to put the players on edge, expecting something to be here.
 
#### Basement
 
After the bell tower scene, when the party leave the church (remember to replay the Sanctuary Scene anytime they enter it no matter which door they enter from), they immediately hear a woman scolding the children they heard and saw after dealing with the jellyfish. They then hear a large metal door slam as the players round the western corner. The door that they heard shut was the door to the shack around the corner that leads to the undercroft. The door is now unlocked and unblocked as the nun hadn't resecured the door before running after the returning children.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Basement scene   You see a landing at the foot of what you can now see is a dark switchback staircase. What do you do?   **When you reach the landing,** the light bounces from the upper floor allowing you to look around the corner and see at the base of the staircase a wall 10 feet away from the base and a sharp left and a sharp right.   **Arriving at the bottom,** you see the right ends at another wall, and the left follows into an open room 20 feet away. It's too dark to see into without assistence. **Those with darkvision roll a perception check (DC15).** *Whisper to the players that pass and tell them they see a statue at the other end of the large room standing on a tall dais, then turn to the players that failed.* You all see a figure at the end of the hall. Tall. Intimidating. It's a little too dark to see any more detail. *Get a marching order.*   **The end of the hall** opens into a large domed, circular room. *Roll some dice for effect then turn to the one in front:* as you enter this room you catch a the head of broom to the face for...2 points bludgeoning damage. A woman in a habit stands in the doorway crying in fear, "stay away! Stay away!"  
</div>
 
The domed, circular room at the end is 40 feet in diameter. On the left and right are a couple benches and in the middle at the back is an alter to Aelus. Some storage crates and barrels are also in the room with random stores of supplies, ale, wine, and non perishable food for the clergy staff all of which now rotten.
 
The party can easily calm Beatrice Codlack the nun and learn from her some information. What she knows is outlined in the sidebar. She also knows information in the [Rumormill](#p6) section. As Bea starts to calm down, they'll see some children poke their heads out of hiding places, curious who she's talking to. It's difficult to place how many children there are hiding.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**On a downbeat,** the door upstairs is heard slamming open, some of the crates fall and shatter. "You didn't block the door?!" Exclaims the woman frantically.  
</div>
 
The characters have 1-2 rounds to get into positions before a pack of wolves gets to the bottom of the staircase. The amount of wolves depends on how many players are at the table and how low they are from the second floor fight. The wolves are meant to be a short, easy fight as a harder one is possibly coming up right behind it. The wolves, as the party can see clearer now they are close, are undead. Skin rots and falls off their corpses. In reality, these are possessed by dybbuks, as are all the undead they'll fight around the churchyard.
 
After the party has disposed of the wolves, if they return to the storage room, the nun and children are gone. Instead, floating in the space of the children are Will-o'-Wisps. The amount of wisps are equal to one more than the amount of characters in the party. This is meant to be a difficult encounter. Each of the wisps that die drop a pearl.   ```  
```
 
> ##### Bea's Info, from her perspective  
>  
> - She and the children saw the ethereal jellyfish just before they sank into the ground.  
> - Wolves were attacking the church. Some of the wolves were dead.  
> - Just after the wolves attacked, some of the corpses of the recently burried rose from their graves, including her father, Tyrian Codlack.  
> - She then quickly rounded up the children and fled here to the undercroft, blocking the door.  
> - Most of the corpses were not burried here in the graveyard. They were burried in the cemetery down the way.
 
##### Ambush
 
Upon leaving the basement, the party encounters 1d3 dybbuk humanoid corpses and 1d4+1 wolf corpses. One of the humanoid corpses is that of Beatrice Codlack.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
# Cemetery
 
Roslyndale Cemetery houses the majority of the town's deceased. Surrounded by a low stone wall, the only entrance is a lychgate to the south. The tutelae have cleared the cemetary of the presence of the dybbuks so the cari can complete their task, so only they, in terms of bad guys to fight, will be found here. The biggest time rift in the cemetery occurs in the mausoleum itself to the left, so when the party first enters the cemetery, that's where they'll be. Since the only possibility for combat is in the very small mausoleum, there was no real need for a full map of this area.
 
Against the northern wall is a statue depicting a hooded, cloaked figure with a feminine silhouette, head down to obscur the face, the hands are conceiled within the large holed sleeves placed in front of the figure's body. To the right is a clearing with more tombstones where an optional encounter that is more lighthearted. Open graves are dotted around the cemetary where the dybbuks rose the corpses.
 
If one of the characters experienced the opening dream, these are recognizably the same locations in the cemetery part of the dream, though what actually stands here are a little different, as outlined in the following sections. The light from the moons shine brightly, illuminating the cemetery in a dim light.
 
#### The Dead Cherry Tree
 
When the party enters the cemetery through the lychgate and continues north, they see a long dead cherry tree sat in the middle of a clearing. This is the same dead cherrywood tree as seen in the vision. A few long dead lanterns hang from the branches. To the north is a path leading to a statue, from which a quiet sobbing can be heard. The west leads to a mausoleum, two figures can be seen carved into the side of the marble building and something is carved above the extra wide ornately carved red wood door. The east leads to a clearing where a figure can be seen milling about aimlessly. These are the same locations that were in the vision dream, though there are differences, some clear, some subtle.
 
#### Statue Path
 
A statue stands against the northern wall of the cemetery, about 30 feet from the cherry tree.
 
The girl is Silifrey Lackman, as she will proudly proclaim if asked, the eldest Lackman child. At the time of their death, Silifrey was 13 years of age.
 
>##### The Queen's Elegy  
>  
> The statue is of Queen Milla, Goddess Queen of the Afterworld, where it is believed in this region the spirits go after death. The plaque at the bottom of the statue reads:  
>  
> Oh come ye tired and weary!  
>  
> All ye who toil days long in the soil.  
>  
> All ye who art in anguish and despair.  
>  
> Come unto mine arms, mine breast,  
>  
> Mine loving embrace.  
>  
> Rest child.  
>  
> Sleep now and be still,  
>  
> For thou hath toiled long enough in thine soil.  
>  
> Grant me thine soul to cradle anon.  
>  
> Eternity's winds do carry thee on.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Statue Encounter   Ahead of you stands a marble statue characterizing a cloaked hooded figure with a feminine silhouette. Her hood drawn far in front of her face obscuring it from view. Her hands folded into her large bell sleeves, concealed and placed to her front. There is a plaque at the base that is a bit too far to read.   As you approach the statue, a young girl is seen weeping silently to herself, her visage is hollow and transparent. She doesn't stir at your approach. What do you do?   **It doesn't take much to get the girls attention. When they do, describe their action, then the following:**   Startled, the girl jumps up to her feet, taking a regal stance. She wipes away her tears saying, "my apologies for making such a display of my emotions. Mother always says, 'a Lady should never show her mind in front of strangers.'"  
</div>
 
When asked why she cries, she'll respond saying, "There are monsters in my house," she points to the mausoleum then continues, "I've tried talking to them and I've tried fighting them. But they don't answer me nor respond to my...um...aggression." She sounds out the word as she speaks it.
 
#### Mausoleum
 
The Lackman Mausoleum interior is a 30 foot by 30 foot square. Although Westra and Heward are the first Lackmans in Roslyndale and the parents are buried elsewhere, the walls are about two and a half feet thick to give enough room for family interment. Currently, the interment slots are all empty.
 
Until filled, the slots were designed as shelves for decoration and can be altered as needed if more space is required.
 
It's original design was intended to be able to hold 15 adult bodies in each full wall, and 6 adult bodies along the entrance wall for a total of 51 adult bodies along the walls.

<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Mausoluem Encounter   You enter the mausoleum and see around you frosted stained glass lining the walls, barred from the inside likely intended to deter graverobbers. Five stone caskets rest on the floor and there are many openings in the walls to allow for the interment of many generations.   Over three of the caskets are legless shades with drawn hoods. A blue magical light eminates from their hands to the caskets they hover above. As you walk in through the heavy door, the one in front turns swiftly in your direction, holding a lantern with hideous faces twisted in agony towards you. The girl runs away screeming in horror.   After a moment, the shade looks at the lantern, shakes it, then points it back at the party. A moment later when nothing happens, it places the lantern on the casket it is above, and takes a defensive stance, as do the others. What do you do?  
</div>
 
These are the zeitgeists, whos stat blocks can be found in the appendices. Their mission here is to heal the time rift that keeps Roslyndale in the loop it currently plays out. Meaning that if left alone long enough, say roughly a few hundred years, everything about this hellscape *should* resolve itself.
 
These tempus cari, as they are truly called, are taking the dodge action. They aren't looking to fight, but, in not knowing the character's intentions, they are getting ready in case the players attack.
 
The cari try everything in their power to stay in the material plane, as if they leave, they'll lose their progress for the day and will have to start over. Hence why the beefier and more combat adept tutelae are sent to an area first to clear out any potential threats.
 
As the cari are defeated, they blink out of existence, their bodies transported to the identical area in the ethereal plane, where they must wait for their bodies to reform before returning to Roslyndale and beginning again. The lantern that the cari placed down is the Tombtaker's Lantern, see the appendices for its stats.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### After scene   After defeating the creatures, the girl enters the mausoleum once more, "Th-thank you," she says meekly, before clearing her throat and straightening up, "my sister made some boots for me some time ago. I'd like you to have them as a reward."   She walks over to a smaller, child sized casket, "BOO!!" another ghostly girl springs out of the casket, startling the first, "did I scare you?" She exclaims playfully.   "Kitty! What are you doing in my bed again?" She demands of the second child.   She looks down, dejected, "Those monsters scared me so I came to find you." An infant's cry can be heard coming from another casket.   "Kitty, now you woke Branlyn." the first says to her.   "Sorry Frey," Kitty looks down apologetically.   </div>   ```  
```
 
<div class='descriptive'>   Frey moves over to the casket and lifts the boy out, cradling the infant, "there, there bean. Your sisters have you." Kitty walks over to Frey and pets the boy's head.   Kitty gestures over to the party, "These nice people scared off the monsters! Say thank you!"   All three fade from view as they rock and pet the boy trying to calm him. A cooing can be heard for a moment after they fade completely.  
</div>   The boots are in whichever casket the players go to. These are the Wind Runners, and you can find stats for them in the appendices.
 
#### Scullery Maid Encounter
 
When the party leaves the cemetery, a woman, Ellian, approaches the group, distraught. As she draws near, the group can see through her visage, this is another ghost. She exclaims that there are scary happenings at the Lackman House, where she works. If the players take the time to interrogate her, she gives her knowledge freely without issue:  
- This is one of the house maidens, specifically one of the scullery maids.  
- She was working towards a promotion and pay raise before the happenings started  
- Mr. Cotton has been coming to the house regularly, then her and the Mistress both go to Mr. Lackman's laboratory on the third floor.  
- Mr. Cotton arrived sometime after midnight, which is unusual and, after some time, strange lights and sounds started to occur and she ran away in fright.  
- Her father rests here and the cemetery and this is where she escapes to when she needs some time to herself, hence why she came here in her fright.  
- She knows that the Mistress hired Mr. Cotton to help her research something, not sleeping with eachother as others would suggest. She does not know the nature of this research.
 
#### Eastern Part of the cemetery, optional
 
In the eastern part of the cemetery, by the clearing, is a fully clothed skeleton very conspicuously rummaging through the grass, lifting stones, and digging shallowly into the ground looking for a shoe. This encounter is entirely optional, but it's intended to be a light-hearted encounter to lift the otherwise dreadful tone of the rest of this adventure. Feel free to have the skeleton notice the party as they are leaving.
 
If it notices the party, it will wave them down in an attempt to ask for help. Its lower jaw will move up and down as it does, but, being a creature without skin or a voice box, no sound comes out.
 
If the party approaches, choose a character and have the skeleton look excitedly at that character's feet and make grabby-gimme hands. A successful perception, insight, or similar check reveals that it is missing a shoe.
 
Let this encounter play out as it does. The skeleton has on its person a Coin of Memories (see appendix).

# The Lackman Estate
 
The Lackman House, the epicenter of the ritual that desecrated the entire town, leaving it the strange reflection it is today, has been affected far more devastingly than the rest of the town. Time moves slower inside the house, as a whole, giving the party less time to explore the house before being cast out the following day, as they have experienced many times at this point. However, time moves at a different rate in every room, which is outlined in the room sections.
 
The temporal shift is active regardless what time of day the players visit the estate and each section will have descriptions for what the characters should expect to experience if they visit during day hours or night hours. The players are only shunted back to the inn beds when the sun rises. A player looking out a window while in the house can make a perception check (DC12) to notice that the sky is moving noticeably faster than normal, as are the trees whose branches are blowing in the wind.
 
## Border Ethereal
 
After sunset, the interior of the house fades to the border ethereal plane, though the exterior walls continue to sit in between both the border ethereal and prime material planes. This means that anyone can enter the house, but leaving is a bit more difficult.
 
Looking out through a window, a character sees what the character should expect to see. It's when attempting to exit the house in anyway, whether through a window or exterior door, that things get strange. Up to 60 feet from the house is a colorless landscape that reflects the normal landscape. About 60 feet away from the house is a massive wall of thick fog that surrounds the perimeter.
 
Anyone that ventures into the fog can look back to see the house becoming increasingly smaller, the further away they go until they eventually lose sight of the house. If anyone does this, they are completely removed from the rest of the group for the remainder of the evening as they become hopelessly lost in between the border and deep ethereal planes. Although, they will wake up the following day with the rest of the party.
 
```  
## Running the Estate, optional
 
If the party enters the estate at night, adjudicate about how many hours are left until sunrise, before the time dilation, and set a timer for ⅔ that amount of time. The description for each room has a time dilation tag. Multiply that number by the amount of time spent in that room. If the time dilation is more than 1, subtract the resulting number from the time remaining until sunrise. If the time dilation is less than 1, add the resulting number to the time remaining until sunrise. If a room or area doesn't have a time dilation number, the time dilation defaults to 1. It's helpful to use a counting up timer and to pause the timer when you take a moment after the party leaves a room to do your calculations.
 
Pause the timer when reading box text and during combat. For every 10 non-continuous rounds of combat, subract 1 minute from the time remaining.
 
##### A helpful chart for converting between hours and minutes:  
| Hours | Minutes | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  
|:-----:|:-------:|  
| 1 | 60 |  
| 2 | 120 |  
| 3 | 180 |  
| 4 | 240 |  
| 5 | 300 |  
| 6 | 360 |
 
As an example, the party enters the house through the main entrance with 6 hours of night remaining, start a counting up timer. The party has 4 hours before sunrise. They take a few minutes to inspect the entry hall then make a right into the library and trigger the residual haunting combat which lasts 3 rounds. Make note that the party have used 3 rounds.
 
Afterwards, they spend about 7 real time minutes searching through the library, which has a time dilation of 3, then leave back into the corridor. Multiply 3 and 7 to get 21 then subtract 21 from the original 4 hours (240 minutes) to get 3 hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes) and 7 rounds of combat remaining.
 
When they are finished in the library, they head over to the event hall and spend 10 minutes looking around. Multiply 10 by the event hall's time dilation of ½ to get 5 then add the result to the remaining time to get 3 hours, 44 minutes (224 minutes), and 7 rounds of combat remaining.  
```
 
## Ambient Residual Haunting
 
During Dr. Lackman's excursions, the butler, Mr. James Mallard, and the house keeper, Ms. Lillian Buchanon, became the de facto guardians and protectors of the house. After the spell failure ripped through the town, most of the staff still haunt the Lackman house, going about their duties. In the final scene of the dream, when the character was being walked to the room at the end of the hallway as the Mistress, the man walking beside them was the butler. Any time the butler is mentioned, feel free to remind the player that experienced the dream that he seems very familiar.
 
Residual Hauntings are outlined in the rooms, but the butler and house keeper are ever present. If any character looks into a mirror they will likely see the two eerily standing over their shoulder, staring. Glimpses of the two can also be seen out of the corners of the characters eyes.
 
For every hour spent in the estate, night or day, have any living creature make a Constitution saving throw (DC13) or gain 1 level of exhaustion and age 2d4 years as the butler and house keeper drain the their energy and life.

> ##### The Lackman Children  
>  
> Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn Lackman were the three children that Westra lost to the plague that swept through the town. If the party visited the mausoleum in the cemetery, these are the children they interacted with. Silifrey was 15 years of age, Kethra was 9, and Branlyn 6th birthday had just passed.  
>  
> The party will be seeing much of these children throughout the estate.  
>
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
## [Ground Floor](#p24)
 
This is the estate's living space. Many things are found on this floor, as described in the following sections, from areas for entertaining guests to more personal spaces for escaping the public eye. There are even a few water closets (WC on the map).
 
A wide cobblestone path leads up to the main entryway framed by two grand pillars. Two massive, ornately carved double doors stand proudly, both doors together depict what look to be a battle between two sides. A successful arcana or history check (DC15) reveals this to be the scene of the titans and betrayer gods on the bottom right corner of the right door against the modern day gods on the bottom left corner of the left. At the top is carved a celestial script that spans the two doors. On the left door translates roughly to, "the are no gods" then continues to the right door, "only very powerful beings." In the center spanning both doors is one figure carved larger than the others looking up in agony. A successful, but more difficult, arcana check (DC25) reveals this to be Diven, the titan Mr. Lackman and a few of his collegues believe to be responsible for rallying the other titans and betrayer gods against the modern day gods, just before being violently fragmented.
 
This is forshadowing for the riddle that the characters will eventually have to solve in order to enter the attic and end the curse.
 
Entering the estate at night, the sky lights up in the distance and a loud crack of thunder is heard followed by a low rumbling. Rain starts begins to thrum loudly against the roof and the sides of the house. If you can, play some heavy rain sounds.
 
### [Entrance Hall](#p24)
 
Locked during the day, the two massive, artfully carved double doors described above lead into a lavish entry hall with decadent tapestries hanging artistically on the walls. A hearth is to the left with a family painting hanging above it. To the right is a set of glass double doors leading out to a veranda. In the back, marking the start of the hallway, are two nicely carved load bearing pillars. There is a heavy wooden door next to the glass door.
 
> ##### Kethra Lackman  
> Kethra was gifted with clairvoyance. This was made stronger by the spell failure that had outstretching consquences creating a fractured point in time where anyone in or around the house and its grounds can losely interact with others regardless of native time period, especially those who are sensitive to such disturbances.  
>  
> Troughout her life, short as it was, she frequently saw many spirits and phantoms. Most of her family and staff accounted this as a child's imaginary friends, regardless of the fact that she had so many of them.  
>  
> She's always had a knack for tinkering and building things and loved mixing magical and mechanical gadgets and contraptions.  
>  
> Her favorite colors were crimson red and natural silver.
 
At night, the hall will be more decrepit. The tapestries will have torn from their own weight over time. Some of the stones in the hearth are cracked and the painting above it droops. One of the load bearing pillars is cracked, leading to the possibility of the upper floor collapsing at some point.
 
### [Ground Floor Corridors](#p24)
 
As with many of the walls throughout the house, the ground floor corridors are covered with different paintings, marble carved busts, tapestries, and other styles of art that were sourced from within the village of Roslyndale.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Ground Floor Verandas](#p24)
 
Not much is found on the verandas other than alternate ways into the estate. They mostly serve as another memory of when the estate was alive and well, but can be utilized to peak into other areas for reconnaissance before entering. When the characters step out onto a veranda at night from within the estate, pause the timer to read the corresponding box text, then drop the players out of the memory, start the timer again, and let them decide where to go next. The first time the party is physically outside, refer to the [Border Ethereal](#p22) section to describe what they see as they interact with the outdoors.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Entry Hall  
It's a brisk, cloudy day as you step out onto the veranda. You walk over to the glass table in the center. It's been an exciting week as you finally take a seat in your new home. You and Heward have been planning this for years and it's finally here. An espresso sits on the table. You squeeze the lemon zest into it and watch your movers carry in Heward's bar globe. A few moments later, his rolltop desk is moved in as well. You sip the espresso and feel the warmth as it travels down your throat.   The vision fades leaving you standing on the terrace. The warmth of the espresso still in your belly slowly fades with it.  
</div>  
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Library / Event Hall  
Spectral dancers twirl and shimmer resplendently under the moonlight as a warm breeze brushes gentle against your faces. Some veranda furniture is also set up with people sitting in chairs enjoying tea and wine and ale, reading books and talking, though no sound is heard. The phantasmal dancers seem completely unaffected as they dance through the furniture and seated guests.   Two girls skip up to one of the seated pair, one of whom holding an infant. One girl looks to be 13 wearing a blue dress with gold colored trim, the other appears to be about 7 wearing a red dress with silver trim. The infant appears to be a few months from 2 years. The two speak to the pair, though no sound is heard. Their body language says they need help with something and the ghostly forms of the pair stand, excuse themselves and follow the children through one of the bordering doors against the shorter wall and vanish into the next room.  
</div>   The three children are Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn Lackman. The pair they speak to are their parents, Heward and Westra Lackman.

<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Arcade  
A storm starts to gather as you finish your game of Nine Men's Morris with Westra. She has beaten you yet again, though what else were you expecting when you knowingly make a few bad moves. She bounds up in excitement with her victory as a gentle rain begins to fall and the two of you move the board and chairs against the house. She doesn't seem to have noticed that you've been losing on purpose to encourage her to play more.   For you, it's not about winning, it's about being with your beloved wife. Being as learned and intrepid as you are, along with your work that forces you to travel far and for long periods of time, you need to make every moment count with your family that you can for one day, you fear, you may not return.   You stand watching the rain drop into your fountain, your arms around Westra and smoke rising from your pipe, knowing this fragile peace is not far from being broken. The vision fades and you feel this peace resound through your entire being.   Until you finish your next long rest, you have advantage on all wisdom saving throws and are immune to the frightened condition.  
</div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Dining Room  
It's a beautiful mid-morning day today as you step out onto the veranda from your dining room. You're still relatively new to the village, but you love it here all the same. Just you, your husband, and your daughter. The tree line in the distance sparkles brilliantly as the morning dew finishes evaporating off the leaves. You see your fountain in your garden in the back and smile as Heward's voice calling from within the house, "I'll be right out darling. Just putting together a little something for Silifrey."  
</div>
 
### [Library](#p24)
 
The library was a place Mr Lackman could keep books that didn't need to be kept secreted away from prying eyes. He would bring his children here and teach them the ways of magic and wizardry. Silifrey was the most adept of the two that were old enough to study such wonders. Kethra was more of a scientist who loved toying with taking everything apart and "improving" them, often trying to mix the mundane with the magical. Any of the staff or public was allowed in the library to read or withdraw books as long as they were returned and thus was never locked.
 
A large, heavy dictionary sits on a pedestal in the middle of the room made to cradle large, heavy tomes. A hearth is to the right with three chairs surrounding it. A Heaven's Chronical sits on a table near the bay window next to a Star Gazer (telescope worth 2,000gp) and star gazing journal. This was one of his prized possessions and he enjoyed showing it off to people whenever he could. Being the powerful mage he was, he wasn't concerned with someone stealing these treasures as he'd very easily be able to find the thief.
 
When the party first enters the room, there can be seen an older man sitting in one of the chairs reading. This is not Mr Lackman. When the characters enter the library for the first time each visit, the man slowly looks behind him, bones cracking and popping as he does, and states, "you are not welcome here!" He stands swiftly and lifts his arms, vanishing as he looks upwards and books start flying off the shelves. The air crackles with malevolent energy as the books turn hostile, hurtling towards the players. Roll initiative!
 
### [Event Hall](#p24)
 
Countless memories were made here and time always seemed to slow while in this hall, which was used for a great many events, from after wedding parties and funeral gatherings to celebrations of life and the seasons. Once every year, the Lackmans would also hold a masked ball for the village residents, to boost morale. The Lackmans would put up their old dresses and suits for rent as well as pay the village mills to put their textiles on sale as villagers were encouraged to attempt to make their own outfits.
 
At night, when the characters walk in, in addition to a more ragged scene depicted above, they see masked spirits dancing an older dance in suits and large dresses. A successful perception check reveals the clothing is slightly mismatched. Some have clothing that's too big, others have ripped, or amateurly tailored clothing. A band stands on a portable 10ftx5ft stage on the eastern side of the room by the large window. Neither the band, the spirits and the stage can be interacted with in any way.
 
### [Parlour](#p24)
 
This room was mostly used in life as a means to entertain guests while the Lackmans finished up with the preceeding appointment. In here can be found some books on a table for reading next to the couch and chairs by the hearth, two pedestals along the back wall showcasing magic items, as well as a chess set enchanted to play the opposing color with a few different difficulty settings. In the left pedestal is a leather cuff adorned with rune eched bones and the bottom jaw of an animal (see Ancestral Cuff in the appendix). In the pedestal on the right holds a sack of magic coins (see Cursed Coin Pouch in the appendix). In front of this sack are replicas of the coins within it.
 
At night, the only things that aren't run down are the magic items in the since broken cases and the chess table and chairs. If anyone is ever within 5ft of the chess set, namely to get to the magic items, the chess set moves ash king's pawn to D4. **Wait to see if anyone sits at the table willingly to play.**
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
If no one sits down at the table, have everyone that witnesses this move make a DC15 Charisma saving throw. Of those that failed, the one that rolled the lowest is compelled to sit on the black side and play. Anyone else that failed is compelled to watch the game unfold.
 
#### [Playing Chess](#p24)
 
Have the character that is playing chess and the chess set itself roll three opposing Intelligence checks. The chess set is set to the Grand Master difficulty setting, Mr. Lackman's favorite, and gets a +8 bonus. If the character is proficient in chess, they may add their proficiency modifier.
 
If the character accumulates 3, they win, on 2 successes, there is a stalemate, and if they accumulate only 1 success, they lost the game. In either case, record the difference in the opposing rolls, with the player wins being positive, and the chess set's wins being negative. At the end of the match, add up the cumulative difference and refer to the corresponding win/loss charts that follow to know the reward or penalty.
 
For the sake of storytelling, when calling for Intelligence rolls while playing chess, describe the outcome of the rolls in between each roll to build tension, instead of calling for the rolls all at the same time.

### [Study](#p24)
 
This is where Mr. Lackman relaxed and enjoyed his time away from everything. His experiments, entertaining guests, and general runnings of the household. After he was finished with his reponsibilities, he would come here to cool down, have a drink and a smoke, and write. Short stories, daily thoughts, journaling. This was his space.
 
On occasion, he loved sharing this room with his children, whom he cherished dearly. The only rule he had was to never enter this room without him, as he placed a magical trap on the room that, because of the spell failure, could be dangerous.
 
In this room can be found his bar globe with what were fine liquors and wine all in crystal decanters and a few glasses, a writing desk of inspiration, the stats should you need them are in the appendix, next to which sits a Heward's Handy Haversack, and three locked bookcases with magical tomes held within. A few magical book examples can also be found in the appendix.
 
When the party first enters this room, pause the Estate timer and read the following box text first then start a 5 minute timer and refer to the chart to see how high the water rises after each minute. This is designed to be instill terror as they live through this trap. The doors and windows are magically sealed during the 5 minutes and cannot be opened or broken by any means.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
##### Study Description   As you step into the room, you hear a k-tik as the door closes gently behind you. To your left, ominous caged bookcases loom, casting long, eerie shadows across the floor and a weathered roll top desk sits centered on the right side of the room between to large windows and under a grand landscape picture depicting Veraudinus and his siblings Aide and Minuris dancing resplendently across the sky, shining brilliant light onto the treetops and a glistening lake. A fireplace is in the corner just to your right with a chair in front, another caged book case sits between it and you. In front of you stands another grand bay window, this time with a chair and globe in front of it.   A moment after taking in the interior of this room, a blinding flash of light enters from the windows as a loud cacophonous roar explodes above the estate **(make a thunder sound if you can)** almost deafening. The drumming of the rain becomes heavier and heavier. As the bay window begins to leak, you look down and find yourselves standing in low water. Turning in horror, you see water gushing through the doors with relentless force, trapping you. Water starts to spew from the books and from the paintings. Water surges in, rapidly rising, as panic sets in - the room is transforming into a watery grave.   What do you do?  
</div>
 
In this, there is no way out but through. That being said, always reward clever thinking. This completely suppresses all magic designed to change someone's form, and as such wildshaping and polymorphing doesn't work here.
 
Additionally, the trap was only designed to deter curious minds, but because of the spell failure, the magic warped and now frightens.
 
> ##### Who was Mister Lackman?  
>  
> He's not widely spoken of in this tale and plays only minor roles in it. In my setting, he is one of my major wizards of power who often left town in search of many wonderous items and magical studies.
 
In the following chart, everything is relative to the average human height  
##### Water Height  
| Minute | Height |  
|:------:|:------:|  
|1|The bay window bursts and water is up to the knees  
|2|Water pours in from the hearth, the bookcases, and the globe and the water is now up to the navel  
|3|The other windows burst open and the level is up to the shoulders  
|4|The doors burst open as the water rises above their heads  
|5|The water level is now up to the ceiling  
|6|Read the following box text
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Aftermath  
**Speak slowly and softly**   After a few moments, you release your last breath, and your arms go slack. First Yg. Then Allanon. Finally Dampé. One by one each of you lose consciousness as you feel yourselves descend slowly towards the floor.   **Wait a few moments before continuing**   As you descend your bodies right themselves feet down and you land gently on the floor. You take a look around and see the wall to your left is lined with caged bookcases and a weathered roll top desk sits centered on the right side of the room between to large windows and under a grand landscape picture depicting Veraudinus and his siblings Aide and Minuris dancing resplendently across the sky, shining brilliant light onto the treetops and a glistening lake. A fireplace is in the corner just to your right with a chair in front, another caged book case sits between it and you. In front of you stands another grand bay window, this time with a chair and globe in front of it.  
</div>
 
At this point, the PCs are free to interact with the study as they wish. The doors and windows are no longer locked or sealed and can be opened freely.

### [Chapel Ground Floor](#p24)
 
Inside this room are ashwooden pews that line the floor with a narrow walkway leading up to a rather large altar framed by two massive stained glass windows depicting scenes of agriculture much like in the church. There are three doors around the chamber, two leading to the hallway and one leading to the study.
 
This room was a place of worship for the Lackman staff. Ceremonies were also held here, such as blessing's, funeral rites, and weddings. It basically served as another, smaller church, giving residents another option for whatever is needed.
 
At night, ask everyone entering the room to make a dexterity saving throw except for any that benefit from the web walker feature, as the entire room is covered in a thick layer of webs. The area is considered lightly obscured (perception checks and attacks rolls relying on sight are made with disadvantage) and is difficult terrain in all directions, including vertically. The storm outside begins to beat down on the house more heavily.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
##### Ground Floor Scene  
Those who failed the save immediately walk right into a thick layer of webs. Looking through the webs is very difficult as it lightly obscures everything around you, though you can faintly make out wooden pews and some kind of altar along the back wall. Through the webs you hear a child in the far corner screaming in fright, "no! Not you too!"
 
You hear a door slam open to your right and young footsteps run over to the girl, "Kitty! Kitty! Wake up! You're having another phantasm! Wake up!"
 
Hissing and clicking descend from above as the girl screams once more pointing upwards, "they're coming!"
 
Roll Initiative!
 
**During the fight, Kitty will say something along the lines of, "these are different, Frey. They are fighting the monsters. I think these ones are here to save us!"**  
</div>
 
The first girl is Kethra and the second is Silifrey. When together, they are both in the far corner away from any of the doors.
 
> ##### Silifrey Lackman  
>  
> Like her sister who was gifted with clairvoyance, and her father who was gifted with telekenesis, Silifrey was gifted with telepathy, which she often used to sus out who was lying and what was the actual truth. Lies to her were an abomination and she was exceptionally vocal when uncovering the truth, no matter the cost.  
>  
> Silifrey always had a natural talent for the arcane arts, and loved painting and drawing these ancient symbols. She was elated when Mr. Cotton moved to Roslyndale, as she was able to continue her magical lessons in the absence of her father. Reading from a book is great, but speaking with others with experience is immensely helpful.  
>  
> Her favorite colors were a cobalt blue and gold.
 
### [Dining Room](#p24)
 
This room was mostly used to host grand feasts and parties. A large pit is in the center of the room with a hefty contraption on top.
 
The Lackmans are hosting a large party when the PCs enter the room, with the hosts on the dais at the back of the room and every seat in the room filled. Laughter and cheer is heard throughout the hall and everyone is euphoric. Looking around, though, reveals that everyone in the room is frozen in time and if any of the guests are inspected, they flicker like a candle in a light breeze. It's at this point the characters realize the laughter sounds distant and ghostly, just like the images of the people. The sounds of glee fade and all that is left is complete silence. Even their footsteps make little noise.
 
In one of the corners can be seen amongst these silent phantoms, a small humanoid shape. Branlyn is here, hiding. Wanting to be a part of the group, but knowing he is too young to join. Yet join he did, against propriety, and against his parents' instruction. When the party approaches him, a hand appears seemingly from the wall, grasps the scruff of his neck, and yanks him into the ethereal plane. Describe this as Branlyn being yanked into the wall.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Rescuing Branlyn Lackman](p24)
 
After the party sees Branlyn get kidnapped, the party must enter the ethereal plane in order to save him.
 
Once they find a way in, they must pick up on his trail, not an easy accomphlishment in the realm where no one walks. It was the dybbuks that yanked the child into the ethereal in hopes that they could use him as a pawn to their own ends. Unfortunately, because of their hunger and twisted humor, the outlook doesn't look good for young Branlyn Lackman.
 
> ##### The Ethereal Plane  
> Because of the nature of the ethereal plane, getting to the showdown where the party actually fight the dybbuks for Bran's life was intentionally left abstract. Getting there is a matter of imagination and intention in a way that would be too large for a single chapter.  
>  
> Here are a few things to keep in mind, however:  
>- What does your ethereal plane look like? Mine is basically a dream world where the colors are either exceptionally vivid or extraordinarily muted, with colossal animals, birds, and even fish moving through with ease.  
>- When the party catches up with the dybbuks, they are dangerously close to where the border ethereal meets the deep ethereal. After the fight, decide how easy it is for the party to return to the house. Can they see it with a high enough check? What kind of check would they need to return?  
>- What happens if they wander too far into the deep ethereal (accidently or on purpose)? Maybe there is some kind of denizen that can help them return...for the right price, of course. A Hag, perhaps?
 
#### Entering the Ethereal Plane  
There a few ways into the ethereal plane from here, though the party may need a some guidance to understand this. As mentioned before, the Estate already sits on the border ethereal plane and thusly can be reached if they move through the fog that borders the house. If the party walks to the outside of this room as a result of seeing Branlyn get spirited away, feel free to opt out of reading the viranda scenes.   If during any of the encounters prior to the party enterring the estate, one or more of the [tempus cari](p) passed to the ethereal plane to follow the party instead of fight, a thing that they are likely to do, one or more of them can exit the ethereal plane to help the party through the border, or tell the party how to get through using the fog.
 
#### Saving Branlyn Lackman
 
Once the party enters the ethereal plane, guide them to wear they saw Branlyn get kidnapped. From here, have the party pick up the trail, which leads into the fog wall. When the party catches up, they realize that Branlyn was stolen by a few dybbuks. The showdown happening in the middle of a forest with muted colors.
 
If the party saves Branlyn, when he is summoned by Westra in the end, he will side with the party.
 
#### Failing to Save Branlyn
 
If the party either fails to save Branlyn, or decides it isn't their problem and doesn't go after him, consequences might ensue. If the party doesn't enter the dining room, Branlyn is summoned in the Westra fight with the stats listed.

### [Kitchen](#p24)
 
As soon as the characters walk into the room, read the following box text in the thickest Scottish Brogue you can muster.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You enter into the kitchen, late again. Chef stands with his back toward you at the center wooden table, chopping carrots on a maple wood cutting board. "Well it's about bloody time you lot got here!" He exclaims not turning to you as you enter. You look down and see that you are all wearing cooking attire, "I've had prepare the damn food alone. If I had anyone else to choose from, you would not be working here anymore. Get your arses over here and help me!" Unprepared food lines the center and window tables. To your right is a large pot in the grand hearth to the left side and a grate large enough for grilling and pan-cooking to the right.   What do you do?  
</div>
 
This is Chef Gorren Ramski. If the party refuses him, he'll give them one warning, asking them once more to assist them, politely through gritted teeth. If they resist again, he outright attacks them. See the Ramski Fight later in this section. If the party acquiesces, jump to the section titled The Meal.
 
#### The Meal
 
In this particular memory sequence, the characters are playing through cooking for a dinner party hosted by the Lackmans and orchestrated by Chef Gorren Ramski. Everything in the memory has been "rehearsed" many times over to the point where the staff knows exactly when to cook what. To get around the players not having this knowledge, tell them which course they are preparing, referring to the table below, and allow the players to discuss what they want to cook and serve for that course. Whatever the players decide is on the menu is what was rehearsed, with the idea that anything that is prepared has to actually be edible meals.
 
After the players announce their idea for the first course, the Hors D'oeuvres, which should have 3 canapés, declare that this is a skill challenge with 12 checks and have one of the characters take lead on the first check. If the players get stumped on any of the courses, mark off a failure as Chef Ramski scolds them for incompetence before telling them what to make. If the players fail any 3 checks, they fail the skill challenge and Chef Ramski attacks. Jump to the section titled The Fight.
 
When a course is finished, describe spectral staff members enterring the kitchen to retrieve the plates.
 
```  
```
 
##### The Meal  
| Course | Example |  
|:------:|:--------|  
| Hors D'oeuvres / Canapés (served while everyone is arriving) | Goat cheese crostini with fig-olive a tapenade, figs with bacon and chili, and gaspacho shooters |  
| Amuse Bouche (served when everyone sits) | Brie and chopped apricots over endives with a creaned honey glaze |  
| Soup | Creamy leek and yam soup |  
| Appetizer | Mushrooms stuffed with pecorino romano, garlic, and bread crumbs |  
| Salad | Garden salad with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a tart vinaigrette |  
| Fish | Crispy trout with a parsley-caper vinaigrette |  
| Fowl | Roasted duck with an orange-ginger glaze |  
| Palate Cleanser | Lemon sorbet |  
| Meat | Stuffed lamb breast with lemon, ricotta, and oregano |  
| Cheese Platter | Brie, herbed camembert, humboldt fog with sea salted barley and rye crackers |  
| Dessert | Apricot and strawberry cheesecake |  
| Mignardise (after dessert drink or espresso, served in a small cup) | Bite-sized wafers topped with caramel and dipped in Karimese chocolate alongside Niranese fire water (whiskey) |
   

#### The Fight
 
If the players fail the challenge, or outright refuse to "get to work," Chef Gorren Ramski explodes in a fit of rage, doing 4 fire damage to everyone within 10 feet of him, then attacks the nearest character. After the surprise round, choose some or all of the following monsters to join the fight. The stat block for Chef Ramski can be found in the appendices.
 
- Swarms of (based around swarm of books, except for damage type):  
- Chef's knives (slashing)  
- Cutlery (piercing)  
- Cookware (bludgeoning)  
- Cooked food (fire)  
- Desserts (cold)  
- Stock elemental (based on water elemental; all bludgeoning damage is changed to fire damage; immune to fire and resistant to cold damage; doesn't have the Freeze trait.)

### [Servant's Room](#p24)  
**Time Dilation:** Pause the timer
 
This room is placed here as a place of rest. A place where nothing tense happens. This room is for the characters to catch their breath, plan moving forward in a confusing, ever changing village, and possibly gain some insight and information.
 
If the characters get too lost, feel free to have some notes on the desks or books on the shelves explaining a few things from the perspective of the staff. Alternativle, if Mole is with the party, feel free to have him speak up when the party gets too lost, just remember, he only knows what he has researched, nothing more.
 
### [Offices](#p24)
 
The offices are where the managers of the estate staff do their paperwork.
 
#### House Keeper's Office
 
To the right of the pantry is the House Keeper's office where Ms. Buchanon does the paperwork for the estate. Her responsibilities included paying the estate staff, making sure cleaning supplies were stocked and paid for.
 
#### Chef's Office
 
(Put this part in a sidebar near the kitchen fight)
 
In my world, Chef Gorren Ramski was a renowned chef in the kingdom that disapeared one day under mysterious circumstances with the rest of his former adventuring party.
 
Before then, Chef
 
#### Butler's Office

## [Chamber Floor](#p24)
 
When the party gets to the top of the staircase, the PC that had the initial dream recognizes the hallway in front of them as the hallway from that dream. The difference in this case is that the doors to either side are not locked. A faint sobbing can be heard coming from behind the door at the end of the hallway
 
Additionally, when the party enters each of the rooms, they come across the Mistress as she appears after the spell failure. Each room has a scene the party witnesses, followed by one round of combat, after which the Mistress disengages from combat and floats into a different room. After the party experiences her in all the rooms, she instead floats upwards into the top floor where the party then has to solve a riddle before facing her in the final showdown. Don't count HP here, even if the party does enough to kill her outright. We are going for cinematics in this phase.
 
Something to note: this section is assuming that at this point, the party knows the names of the Lackman children, and the white boxes reflect this. If they don't, maybe they decided to climb in through a window on the second floor instead of just going through the front door, then instead of naming the children, just describe the children instead.
 
### The Door at the Top of the Stairs
 
The door at the top of the stairs is locked, but is the location for the final showdown. There isn't a keyhole and there isn't even a door knob. The area behind the door is protected under a permanent 9th-level casting of Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum preventing sound into or out of the room, teleportation, divination sensors, and planar travel. Additionally, the spell is anchored to an object within the room and cannot be dispelled or suppressed by any means. What is present is a poem engraved and glowing:
 
To my beloved children
 
Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn
 
The key to my laboratory
 
Is hidden within an old story
 
Where you learnt to count
 
With the dryad who'd frount
 
And lead all her friends to glory
 
The answer to this riddle, Diven's Rest, is hidden within the children's book in the Lackman children's room, which can be found in the files.
 
> ##### Who is Diven?  
>  
> Diven was Mr Lackman's life study.
 
```  
```
 
### [Westra's Room](#p24)
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you enter this room, you see a glowing blue woman **or read as "the same blue woman" if the party has seen her before** sobbing with her arms outstreched over a large bed with three children lying on the bed, not moving. Kethra, who appear a few years older, looks weakly towards the door with a sickly green face covered with boils, and whispers, "Goodbye old friends." The glowing woman wails in dispair and her daughter's head slumps back down onto the pillow.
 
**Turn towards the character that had the dream.** Once again a floorboard creaks under your weight and the woman's head shoots up towards you, the scenery fading behind her. She stands and with a flick of her wrist attempts to throw you, just as she did in the dream. Roll a Strength Saving Throw with advantage.
 
Roll Initiative.  
</div>
 
The Mistress attempts to throw the character into the nearby closet, just like in the dream. Having seen this happen before, the character would know it is coming, therefore giving them advantage.
 
### [Branlyn's Room](#p24)
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you enter this room, you see a glowing blue woman **or read as "the same blue woman" if the party has seen her before** hovering over a cradle trying to pick up young master Branlyn, her back to the door. Kethra runs through the groups legs with a glowing stick and swings widely at the woman, which connects. Kethra then fades and the woman whips around angrily and hisses at the party.
 
Roll initiative!  
</div>
 
The youngest of the Lackman children, Branlyn, showed an early fascination with music and instruments and was likely to grow up to be a bard. He and his nanny, Ms. Tetra Withers, spent many long hours in this room. She didn't have the most musical ear, but that didn't matter to young master Branlyn. He loved all the instruments she played for him.
 
One of his most prized possessions was a zoetrope crafted and imbued by his sisters, Kethra and Silifrey Lackman, of a man playing an organ while a sweet tune is played in tandem. The song that is played by the zoetrope can be found in the files of this adventure.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Kethra's Room](#p24)
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you enter this room, you see a glowing blue woman **or read as "the same blue woman" if the party has seen her before** in the corner, standing over Kethra, who is frightened and crying from fear. The woman is sobbing sorrowfully with arms outstrecthed as though trying to embrace the young Kethra, who sees you enter the room and cries out for help. This infuriates the woman who whips around to turn to you sharply and hisses angrily at you all. Roll Initiative!  
</div>
 
If the party decides to explore the room, Kethra thanks the party and runs forward to give them a hug. She fades right before she gets to touch the closest party member, even if a party member tries to run towards her in return.
 
Being an artificer, Kethra has created many inventions and her room reflects this. She has a work table with a basic set of tinker's tools. A few items she had created while alive may have survived through to current time. If you decide to create a few items of your own that she's created, remember to keep them simple. She was only a child, afterall. The objects I've created are more mechanically based and include some kind of quirk. I'll list a few below:
 
- A pocket watch that never needs to be wound but if you don't feed it, it dies. The pocket watch can be revived by soaking it in a bowl of blood, at which point, a whirring sound is heard before the watch starts to tick again.  
- A wand with a gemstone on one end that glows whenever magic is near. This includes itself.
 
### [Silifrey's Room](#p24)
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you enter this room, you see a glowing blue woman **or read as "the same blue woman" if the party has seen her before** hovering over Silifrey, who is feverishly writing at her desk while glancing at the magical circle inscribed in the floor behind her. She doesn't appear notice the glowing woman behind her as she sobs, trying to get Silifrey's attention.
 
Angrily, the woman thrusts her hand foward and the globe on Silifrey's desk lifts up, to her surprise and astonishment. Then the woman turns sharply towards the door where you are standing and with a throw of her hand the globe flies in your direction. The woman then notices you all standing there and hisses at you.
 
Roll initiative!  
</div>
 
Silifrey on the other hand is direct student of the arcane, like her father. Her room include a spot to imbue items with magical abilities to further her education into the arcane. Her items, if you decide to create some, are more spell based, and often have some kind of flaw. Examples include:  
- A hat of disguise but when you speak the command word, only the hat is changed.  
- A pair of boots of teleportation but whenever you speak the command word, only the boots teleport.  
- A horn of invisibility that turns you invisible so long as you continue to blow into the horn. The horn can be heard in a 500ft radius.
 
She stores these items in her walk-in closet. Feel free to describe broken items that look cool but are no longer functional, as well.
 
### [Chapel Upper](#p24)
 
The upper floor of the chapel was used by the Lackman family, themselves. On this floor of the chapel sits uphostered pews overlooking the dais and pulpit. Two more stained glass windows stand from the floor to the ceiling, a bit wider out from eachother than on the first floor. These windows, like the ones downstairs, depict more scenes of Aelus, God of Agriculture.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When the party arrive in this area, either by finding a way to ascend from the ground floor or by enterring through the double doors on the chamber floor, they see a middle-aged man and woman, Mr and Mrs Lackman, sitting in the center pew, two young girls, Kethra and Silifrey, sitting on the pew to the left, and a young woman holding an infant boy on the pew to the right. The young woman is Ms Tetra Withers and she is holding young master Branlyn.
 
Kethra turns to party and smiles excitedly and starts to get up before the middle-aged couple shushes her and tells her to sit back down. She reluctantly obliges, but motions to the party to sit next to her and her sister. The party is free to do so, or not.
 
If the party joins her, she begins to bombard them with all sorts of questions ranging from personal questions about the party themselves, to impersonal questions about tinkering and magic. She'll even talk about some of her inventions, musing about things she's excited to create, problems she is stuck on, and things she's proud of having made. The kinds of questions that children often ask when allowed. The questions start off as whispers so as to not interupt the sermon downstairs, but quickly get louder as she becomes more and more excited to have friends to talk to.
 
After a few minutes of this, her sister nudges her to stop talking with her imaginary friends, which she does for only a few seconds before continuing the conversation. After a few more minutes, one of her parents will shush her again. She gives them a forelorn look and her father will look back to her and say kindly and quietly, "it's wonderful to ask questions, but they really should wait until after the service. If you can wait quietly, we'll talk until bedtime, okay Kitty?" Kethra nods and smiles then reaches to hold the hand of the nearest party member. After a moment, the parents, Ms Withers, the sound of the sermon and the vivid colors of the past all fade away and the bodies of the children fade into will-o'-wisps.  
</div>
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
A few moments later the wisps dance around the room playfully before zapping the PCs. The party is welcome to leave without threat of the Lackman wisps following. Otherwise roll initiative. Something to note, the Lackman wisps were only being playful, so once the party starts to fight back, the wisps turn back into the children and they sulk away. Remember, we are trying to create an emotional attachment to these children.  
</div>
   

> ##### Branlyn Lackman  
>  
> Branlyn Lackman was young when we died of the plague that rolled through the village, so his gifts were never known. However, his favorite toys were those that sang a tune or could be used to hold a beat, the musical zoetrope his sisters made being the topmost among them.  
>  
> He loved everything from the hurdy gurdy, a stringed crank box, his father brought home from a trip, to the drums he was gifted by some of the villagers. It was pretty safe to say that had he lived long enough, he was likely to take up the path of troubadour.  
>  
> His favorite colors were bright forest green and bronze.
 
### [Guest Room](#p24)
 
One of the risks for Mistress Lackman and Mr. Cotton involved the witchhunter who forced the Lackman's to quarter him in the estate
 
When it was time for the Mistress and Mr Cotton to perform the ritual, they had to take care of the head witchhunter quartered in the Lackman Guest Room. On the bed is the body of the head witch hunter who's throat was slit. Knowing they can't take on the head witch hunter head on, the Mistress poisoned him with standard food poisoning so he was forced to take a day off and sleep. This provided the opportunity for her to kill him without him defending himself.
 
In the chest can be found some anti-sorcerer items and weapons. The desk has notes with a couple suspects, one of which was Mr Cotton. The shelves have a couple books detailing some lore from your world from the perspective of the witchhunters and the Sovereign Concordat.
 
### [Butler's Room](#p24)
 
Mr. James Mallard, the Lackman's butler, held all the secrets of the family close to his chest.
 
A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a vial of poison in the butler's desk. THis is the poison used to murder the head witch hunter.
 
On the bookshelves are reference books ranging from legal books to the best wines and liquors from different regions.
 
```  
```
 
> ##### Sorcerers In My Campaign  
>  
> are created through an ancient ritual. Originally, they were created to help the humans fight against their enslavement. Unfortunately, now that time is over and the humans no longer need sorcerers. The humans that have since risen to power now fear these humans who can cast magic seemingly with little to no effort and have created a witch hunters guild to hunt down and kill any remaining sorcerers.
 
### [Wash Room and Water Closet](#p24)  
### [Servant's Quarters](#p24)
 
Everytime a character opens a chest in the servants' quarters roll **1dX**. On a 1, the chest is a mimic. For any other number, roll on the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 chart on page DMG136. Any square that has a bed or chest is considered difficult terrain. Note that these are servants quarters, and the servants wouldn't have any other coin denomation above silver pieces. If the treasure roll gives the players 3d6gp, read it as 3d6gp worth of silver and copper.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
## [Top Floor, Final Showdown](#p24)
 
At the start of battle, the Mistress raises her arms, summoning the three Lackman children to the battlefield. Read the "Who's Fighting Who" sidebar to determine the children's disposition towards the party. If any of the children are on the player's side, they turn towards their mother pleading with her to stop before fading into their will-o'-wisp form. Initiative is then rolled.
 
### Mistress Westra Evelynn Lackman
 
The Mistress prefers to stand back and let the others do the fighting for her while she snipes at the characters with her life drain ability **(which I need to nerf, since I'm giving it a bigger range)**. She is smart enough to assess her enemies' weaknesses and target accordingly. Healers first, then battlefield controllers, then the meat heads. However, with such a low wisdom, her survival instinct as atrophied with time and she will fight to the death.
 
On each of her turns, she raises her arms and uses a bonus action to raise another will-o'-wisp within 10ft of her.
 
If anyone gets within 10ft of the Mistress, she uses her telekinetic thrust action to attempt to hurl that player as far from her as possible.
 
Whenever a wisp is killed in combat, a mournful wail erupts from the depths of what's left of her fragmented soul, frightening all non-wisp creatures within 60ft of her. This includes Mr Cotton.
 
On the first round of combat after her first turn, on Initiative Count 20, losing initiative ties, she speaks out confidently, "Go, my children." Every will-o'-wisp fighting for the Mistress, including any of the Lackman children that didn't join the PCs side, gets either one free movement or one free attach each.
 
On the second round of combat on initiative count 20, losing ties, the Mistress points to one of the characters and hisses, "that one's a problem." All will-o'-wisps currently fighting the party moves to that PC. This movement does not provoke attacks of oppotunity.
 
On the third round of combat, the Mistress clenches her fist as she cries out, "bring me their souls." All wisps fighting the party that are within 5ft of a PC get a free shock attack against one creature they can reach.
 
If the Mistress still lives after this round of combat, the sequence starts over at "go, my children" until the Mistress is defeated, at which point she inplodes, ripping a hole in the fabric of the weave. All creatures in the room, not currently behind or holding onto anything must make a DC10 Strength saving throw or be sucked into this hole and be spat out into the Border Ethereal Plane. Mr Cotton and the wisps are automatically sucked into the hole.
 
```  
```
 
### Mr Henry Cotton
 
Mr Cotton is a 6th-level wild magic sorcerer. Being hunted all his life, he has honed his skills and magical ability for concealment, solitary living, and quick escapes.
 
Mr. Cotton spends his turns acting as a battlefield controller. He will do everything in his power to hinder the party by attempting to inflict conditions favorable to the will-o'-wisps using his spells.
 
Mr Cotton spends his first action casting *slow* on up to six creatures. He is also astute enough to assess his enemies' weaknesses. He will prioritize any character not wearing armor first (spellcasters), then any character carrying a holy symbol (healers), then any heavily armored or meat headed character (tanks), and finally any lightly armored characters (rogues and dps characters). Something to note: keep in mind that *slow* is a concentration spell.
 
After the slow spell becomes obsolete for any reason, Mr Cotton may either cast it again, or cast his web spell. He will flip flop between his AoE type concetration spell until he can't any longer. He may even throw in a cheeky suggestion spell, suggesting that one of the characters count all of the nails in this room, for example.
 
Whenever subjected to an important saving throw or ability check, he will use his Tides of Chaos trait to give himself advantage. The first time he does this, he can do so without risk. Any time after that, roll on the wild magic surge table (PHB103) before each subsequent use.
 
### Summoned will-o'-wisps
 
Wisps summoned by the Mistress stay to fight until the death. Any enemy that is disadvantaged in any way, narratively speak, not mechanically, such as restrained, prone, incapacitated, blinded or under attack by another creature, will be targeted by the wisps. Any creature that is brought to 0 hit points, but is still alive, will be prioritized by the wisps until one of them succeeds with their Consume Life ability. Make sure you describe their approach horrifically, "as the wisps descend upon your unmoving, unconscious body, you can feel their pull against your very life force." Something that will make the others aware of the urgency the downed character faces.
 
#### The Lackman Children
 
The Lackman children are special will-o'-wisps. Any of the children who the party helped earlier in the adventure will fight along side the party against the Mistress. For their first turn, each child on the players team will imbue one non-magical weapon per child with some of their life essence, making the weapon magical for the purposes of determining resistances. This lasts until either the child dies in combat or the combat ends, at which point, the magic on the weapon also ends.
 
Additionally, the children bring their own expertise to the battlefield. Namely, Kethra can use her reaction to magically absorb half the damage of one attack against an ally per turn up to a commulated maximum of her maximum hit points, Branlyn casts bless on up to 3 allies, and Silifrey **can do magic stuff**. Also note: unless magically compelled to do so, none of the Lackman children will willingly attack their mother.

## A Secret for the Curious and the Clever

## [Buttery](#p24)
 
The buttery is where all things for drinking go. Flagons, cups, ale, wine, and liquor are all down here. Wine and Liquor, being much more expensive, are separated from the rest behind locked doors, the keys to which were only given to trusted staff. The Lackmans, the butler, and the housekeeper had the only master keys.
 
At night, the staircase is old and rickety. The creature that descends the staircase without inspecting for traps first falls through the staircase and lands prone on the floor taking 1d4 piercing damage as they fall on something sharp. The staircase is low enough for the character to not take additional fall damage.
 
In the center of the Ale and Cheese room is a suit of armor. A plaque on the bottom reads, "[The Penitent Warrior](#p)." The suit of armor activates when someone touches it or reads the poem underneath.

# What Next?
 
So the party defeated the Mistress and her children. What happens now? Well, a few different things could happen, depending on your personal setting, why they came here in the first place, and where you decided to put Roslyndale. This section will describe a few things that might happen next, assuming something comes of this more than whatever treasure they were promised when they took this mission.
 
#### New Owners Of Roslyndale
 
After completing this adventure, the party now comes into ownership of this village of Roslyndale. Maybe the monarch of the area awards them the deeds to the village, maybe this defunked village is very far away from civilization and now the party has a claim to the village.
 
#### The Secrets of Roslyndale
 
Because the village was created by a party whose members included a wizard, Mr. Heward Lackman, there are plenty of things that the party would have missed, and there are many things Mr. Lackman had concealed from the world so they would be forgotten.
 
Whenever the players take a week to investigate the village, have them roll a group investigation check with either their intelligence or wisdom ability.
 
This is less about passing and more about getting a high score. The higher their combined score, the more rare the things they can find. Each thing can be used to start or seed an adventure.
