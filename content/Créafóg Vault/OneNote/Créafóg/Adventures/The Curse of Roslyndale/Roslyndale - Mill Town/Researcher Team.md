Over the years, Erolian citizens have disappeared in this town. Ever since then, the Taoiseachs have deemed this town unfit for travelers, though they haven't told many people for fear that word would spread and make the town attractive. Unfortunately, because of the orcs that constantly bombard the region, Erolyn has never had enough of a surplus of troops or agents to fix the problem in this town, hence the desire to keep it quiet. However, it was originally possible to attain a permit to investigate the town, as long as you do so quietly. Anyone that can take care of the problem and fix the town will be rewarded handsomely.  
This is exactly what happened to a recent team that has gone in to take a look. All but one, a male Polder by the name Mole, has since died from the Romeroes.  
On the 3rd day, the party will find Mole scavenging in an empty house.  
As you enter, you hear a clattering on a table in the next room.  
When you enter the room, you see a plate with some dried meat and vegetables sitting on the dining table and a fork laying haphazardly on top.  
**The party startles Mole when they find him and he pleads for his life.**
