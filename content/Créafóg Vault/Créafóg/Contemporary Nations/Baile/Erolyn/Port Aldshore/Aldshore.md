Update 11Dec23: 
The Mad King has sent sorcerers to the port town. These are the ones who will be harassing the Curator. No ship passes over the demesne of the Dead Lady without her permission, and as such, she and the Mad King have aligned in this regard.

People are falling ill in Port Aldshore, thanks to the orcs of Yurtrus sent by Granny. The illness is affecting and killing the very old, the very young, and those that are already ill. When the Orcs are near enough for the town criers to talk about them, healthy people will also start dying.
