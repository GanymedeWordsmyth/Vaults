[Magic Tattoo]  
Shoulder blades  
The shoulder blades are magic tattoos that allow the recipient to summon two magical scimitars once per day. The scimitars last for 1 hour before they magically vanish and can't be drawn again until the next day.  
The tattoo is available in several variants including: +1, +2, +1 flaming (deals +1d6 fire damage), +1 freezing (+1d6 cold damage), +1 poison (save vs con dc 16, fail -1d4 str damage for 6 hours), +3  
Your body may have up to 2 swords placed on it. +1 swords may be upgraded to +2, or flaming/freezing/poison and +2 swords may be upgraded to +3.  
The tattoo inscription costs the same amount as buying the magic weapon equivalent.
