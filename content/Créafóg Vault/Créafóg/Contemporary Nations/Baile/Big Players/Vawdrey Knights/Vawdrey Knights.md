The Vawdrey Knights, specifically Fearthainne, were important enough to not only name two months after them, but to also take two days away from another month in order to give them to those two months to make them the longest months of the year.

So here's what I'm thinking:
	The year is current 857 years after the end of the Saoirse, which is 57 years after the treaty ended and the protections dropped. The day it actually dropped, a lot of bad shit went down, as many sapients wanted their slaves back and were drooling for when the treaties ended. 
	This is very much in the vein of what Colville speaks of when taking over a stronghold; it's not truly yours until you defend it from outsiders wanting to take it from you. That's exactly what happened. 
	Attacks came from all sides. Marwolaeth, Thadrinnor, Tethys, Karim, the Dreadmire, Granny's Forest. All wanted Baile to fall. To make matters worse, Baile was about to fall from the inside out due to mad [[Sorcerers]]. 
	Enter: the Vawdrey Knights, consisting of [[Fearthainne Solasta]] and his companion [[Coillte]], [[Plab√†s Frik]], [[Grutok the Brutal]], and [[Urraim Sealgair]].
	The Vawdrey Knights not only successfully rebuffed all invasion attempts and created treaties with the surrounding countries, but they also eradicated the sorcerers, thereby saving Baile from the very weapons they created.
[[Urraim Sealgair]]
	Urraim was the first corrupted
[[Grutok the Brutal]]
	Grutok was 16 when he joined the Vawdrey Knights in the year 804. At 17 the Knights eradicated the final sorcerer. At 18 he overthrew the former leader of Gijaklod, renaming it Baloratukkin, in favor of Luthic, in a successful attempt to keep the orcs from stomping out Baile. Now he is approaching 70 and has reigned well for 51 years, far longer than any other orc. Orc life expectancy is 35 and certainly don't reign past age 40-45.
