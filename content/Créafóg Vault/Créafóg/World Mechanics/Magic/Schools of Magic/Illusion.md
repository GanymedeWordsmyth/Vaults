Figment
	Narrative Essence: Figment spells create sensory illusions that have no physical substance but can be seen, heard, or otherwise sensed. These spells are the art of the ephemeral, crafting images and sounds from the ether. Casters of figment spells are seen as illusionary artists, their creations a testament to the power of imagination.

	Complex Sigil: A palette with brushes and a swirl of colors that fade into transparency, symbolizing the creation of illusions that tantalize the senses without substance.
	Deeper Color Meaning: Iridescent hues that shift and change, embodying the fleeting and mutable nature of figments.

Glamour
	Narrative Essence: Glamour spells alter perception, making the unseen visible or the visible unseen. These enchantments are the weaving of veils and the crafting of facades. Casters who specialize in glamour are masters of misdirection, their magic a dance of shadows and light.
	Expanded Somatic Component: A sweeping motion that suggests the draping of fabric over the unseen, or the peeling back of a layer to reveal what is hidden beneath.

	Deeper Color Meaning: Silver tinged with blue, capturing the shimmer of illusion and the fluidity of perception.

Pattern
	Narrative Essence: Pattern spells manipulate the mind directly, creating intricate illusions that trap or mesmerize. These are the spells of the labyrinth, ensnaring the psyche in webs of beauty or terror. Practitioners are the architects of the mind's prisons, their designs too compelling to ignore.
	Expanded Somatic Component: Intricate finger movements that trace complex geometries in the air, each line and curve a thread in the mental snare being woven.
	Expanded Verbal Component: A rhythmic recitation that echoes the patterns being created, its cadence designed to ensnare the listener's thoughts and lead them deeper into the illusion.

	Deeper Color Meaning: Vivid purples and greens, colors that denote enchantment and mystery, drawing the mind into the depths of the illusion.

Phantasm
	Narrative Essence: Phantasm spells summon images from the depths of the mind, making the victim's darkest fears or fondest dreams manifest. These are the spells of the psyche, personal and powerful. Casters who wield phantasm spells are delvers into the soul, their magic a mirror reflecting the innermost thoughts.
	Expanded Somatic Component: A reaching gesture towards the target, as if to pluck a thread from their mind, followed by a spreading of the hands to unfold the illusion in the world around them.
	Expanded Verbal Component: Murmured incantations that sound almost like a dialogue, a coaxing of the subconscious to release its secrets into the caster's hands.
	Complex Sigil: An eye with multiple layers peeling back, revealing a core of light and shadow, symbolizing the revelation of hidden fears or desires through phantasm spells.
	Deeper Color Meaning: Deep reds and shadowy blacks, colors that evoke the depths of the heart and the corners of the mind where phantasms dwell.

Shadow
	Narrative Essence: Shadow spells create illusions with a semblance of reality, a substance crafted from shadow and thought. These spells blur the line between illusion and actuality, their creations almost tangible. Casters of shadow spells are the masters of the penumbra, where light meets dark.
	Expanded Somatic Component: A motion as if drawing material from the shadows themselves, hands moving through darkness to shape and mold the illusion into being.
	Expanded Verbal Component: Low, resonant tones that seem to echo from the shadows, each word imbuing the illusion with a sense of substance, as though pulling the shadows into form.
	Complex Sigil: A silhouette emerging from darkness, its edges blurred and indistinct, representing the nebulous boundary between illusion and reality in shadow spells.
	Deeper Color Meaning: Grays and umbral hues, capturing the essence of shadow, the substance from which these illusions are spun.
