Outline: 12:00
 
Theme/template  
Rule of 3 levels, areas, rooms  
Start with 3 levels  
Each level has 3 areas  
Each area has 3 rooms  
Remember: Don't need all rooms for session 1
 
What do each level represent?  
Level 1 is for the general populace and newcomers back when this place was thriving. There have been a few break ins since, so there is evidence of recent activity and monsters that are as much a part of this dungeon as the PCs  
Level 2 is where everyone lived. Kitchens, smithies, libraries, sleeping quarters. There were guards, and workers  
Level 3 is the hardest level where the villain and treasure are. It contains a lot of monsters and decorations that show off what this place was when it was active.
 
Turn each bit of the level into an area  
The guards needed a place
 
Traps with tension create drama:  
Separate the characters at the same time as monsters appear.
 
A good dungeon rewards exploration, so put in a few easter eggs. An old fireplace for cooking has a hidden lever just under the flue or in the chimney.
 
Force an important choice, have a branch that canâ€™t be backtracked. The party enters an area that then becomes sealed off when a block of stone falls in the entrance. Now they are left to wonder what would have happened if they went the other way.
