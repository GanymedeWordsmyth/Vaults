~~When first entering the kitchen, read the box text then tell the players that even though their characters wouldn't know this in any way, the players have 15~~ **(30?)** ~~minutes to complete the following activity.~~
 
The whole event takes 2 hours after adjustments
 
Box text starts with them being berated for arriving late, and if they entered through the house keeper's pantry or from the main hall, they are also reprimanded for not using the staff's entrance.
 
**When rollplaying Chef Gorren Caudwell, think Gordon Ramsay**
 
Series of tasks to complete for each character as individual skill challenges (make six to ten positions to fill for those purchasing the book who run for larger parties, players roll a d10 to decide which position they fill. If a second person rolls a number that was already rolled, add 1 to the number [looping back to 1 if you get to 10] until you get to a job that hasn't yet been taken.)  
Food prep  
With the advent of the "staff being so late," Chef Caudwell has been forced to start on the starting food prep, multiple dexterity and constitution checks for chopping, cutting, and preparing food. Chef Caudwell will start by pulling someone over to fill this position first then manage the kitchen from there as the chef and expo. He may even sling an insult or two.  
Dishwasher  
Keeps everything clean that isn't bolted down, multiple constitution saving throws as the chemicals being used are caustic. If the character fails the con save, the following con check is made with disadvantage as they are poisoned. Multiple constitution checks for endurance. The poison lasts until the next time they have to make the con save.  
Cleans dishware being brought back from the dining room  
Cook (anyone with proficiency in cook's utensils will fill this roll)  
Multiple intelligence or wisdom checks to continually choose the correct ingredients and make sure the food is cooked correctly. Describe intelligence checks as knowing how each ingredient will change the food and wisdom checks as intuiting which ingredients will fit best. Intelligence checks will be made with a lower DC than wisdom checks.  
Cook's assistant (helps with keeping fire and oven at the right temperature)  
If anyone is left, they'll take up the mantle as cook's assistant to give the cook or food prep (their choice per roll) advantage on their checks with successful constitution checks.  
Responsibilities also include gathering ingredients from the larder and pantry  
~~Food server (food runner)~~  
~~Multiple athletics checks to determine how well and quickly they serve the food as it becomes ready.~~  
Gathering cups and drinks from buttery - Position may be filled twice  
Likely the most difficult challenge. Multiple investigation or perception checks to find all the cups to serve to guests. An easy fight for the first time the buttery is visited. Multiple athletics and constitution checks to keep up with the food being served.
