## Notes
• How would the Curator react to the party wanting to take Del with them? The Curator manages the oblex population pretty strictly. Better question, how can I narratively make an exception for Del leaving? Because, the Curator's initial response would be, "no." Because an unmanaged oblex can be very dangerous.
• They got most of the way to the inner sewers. Next session I want to montage them to the hand-off with Caius, who congratulates Hal and gives Pix an amulet of disguise.
	○ Find out Hal's wishlist and give him something off of there.
• Any questions they have can be answered by Caius. I doubt they'll have many, so I'd like to come up with things Caius can talk about.
	○ "Ah, you've brought reinforcements. Wise decision. The intricacies of this mission are not to be underestimated."
	○ "I hear you have started down the path of wizardry. We just came across something I think may be helpful for you." +1 Arcane Grimoire
	○ Ask how she's getting on as a coyote
	○ Oh! Maybe offer her a position as a fox?
		§ Portal Compass - investigate a portal that opened up?
• After speaking to Caius, Maris approaches the group.
	○ "Oh, absolutely not. Only the dying die. These people are in a coma and we do our best to take as good care of them as possible." Halwen would say 
	○ Describe that the sudden influx of bodies from the illness is putting a lot of strain on the museum. This strain is preventing the Curator from properly screening the minds of the dying and creating new oblexes without them going mad. They are now running amuck in the city and need to be detained. Bring them to the Curator for judgement.
• Directions the group can go in:
	○ Stop the orcs
		§ Will provide answers of the origins of the plague
		§ Can either take them to the capital or to Baloratukkin.
		§ Need to write down orc stats and org
	○ Stop the rogue oblexes
		§ Side quest-ish
	○ Stop the invading thieves' guild
		§ Can eventually take the party to Tethyrd
		§ Also, while investigating rival guild, they can work to arrest the rogue oblexes
		§ The Twilight King can enter dreams. As the party investigates, maybe one of them is visited by him?
			□ Speaking of dreams, Oma's coven brings people into their dreamscape. Maybe Oma sees the trouble in the Tetyrians invading and that the party is investigating.
			□ Jess has hinted that Rose might be taking a warlock path. Maybe target her?

## Additional Notes
• Very important note: what if Del is Molly???
	○ Better question, what if the Del oblex melded with the Molly oblex, creating one oblex with both?
	○ Ngl, I really like the idea that Del is actually Molly
	○ So, why didn't Rose recognize her, then? I think Del didn't recognize Rose because Del isn't quite used to, well, existing. I think honestly, something as simple as the light was too low and the goggles distorted her face. As to why she didn't recognize the voice, again, Del is still used to being alive.
	○ Also, what kind of stuff would Del say? 
		§ Rose wants to know what happened to her. So let's start there. Halwen identified the illness, but was far too late to help. The illness is one of those illnesses that is easily and readily curable in its early stages, but impossible in its later stages. This is when Molly was found. Its symptoms also look like the symptoms of something very common and is usually only diagnosed in rich children because the doctors have more time and resources to correctly diagnose this. In the poorer communities, the doctors diagnose it as the less severe one as the medicine for the more severe one is far more expensive (tuberculosis: affects the poor more readily than the rich and is hard to diagnose and treat). Since there was a plague coming, the doctors just assumed Molly had that plague instead.
	○ Possible diseases:
		§ Turns out Scrofula was known as the Parent of Disease and most diseases were misdiagnosed or attributed to scrofula…Scrofula is very difficult even by today's standards to diagnose. It presents with small nodules around the neck and unexplained weight loss. This means that Molly would have been super skinny with nodules on her neck, which could have distorted her facial features. 
		§ Erysipelas is caused by the streptococcus bacteria. 
		§ Okay fine…the two that most fit the criteria I am looking for are leprosy and syphilis.
		§ Okay okay okay…fine…Leprosy it is. It's my job to pick the right thing, not the cool thing.
	○ Halwen tried to save Molly, but it was too late for her. The next best thing would be to screen her for oblexification. Unfortunately, Halwen could not save Molly in her death form nor even the few years after contracting leprosy. Doing so would have her reliving her agony. So she had to take Molly's memory from when she was 5 years old. This would lead Rose to not really recognize her at first for a few reasons:
		§ Rose is not necessarily expecting Molly to be a few years younger
		§ Molly is no longer disfigured by the illness
	○ Molly quotes:
		§ "Oh, uh, well…I died."
		§ "I'm not really sure [what the sickness was]. Come, Halwen would know. She's the one that tried to treat me!"
		§ "Oh, that?" [being an oblex status] "I'm not really allowed to talk about that. Uhmm. I think Halwen is allowed to though. She's one of our elders."
		§ "Oh, yeah…I remember that name. If it's okay, I think I like the name Del now."

## Molly's Illness
For a disease that fits your description—disproportionately affecting the poor, harder to diagnose due to its rarity, presenting similarly to more common conditions, progressing to disfigurement and extreme pain, and having a fatal outcome within one to two years—leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) is a historical disease that closely matches these criteria.

Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)
Background: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It has affected humanity for thousands of years, and it was particularly stigmatized in medieval societies.

Symptoms and Progression:

Early Stages: The disease can begin with mild, nonspecific symptoms that might be mistaken for other skin conditions or diseases. Initial signs can include patches of skin that are slightly redder or lighter than normal skin, numbness in the hands, feet, or other areas, and muscle weakness.
Disfigurement and Pain: As the disease progresses, it can cause severe disfigurement, especially of the hands, feet, and face. The nerve damage from leprosy can lead to loss of feeling in the limbs and extremities, making injuries more likely, which can lead to secondary infections and further disfigurement. The disease can also cause painful neuropathy.
Duration: Leprosy can take years to manifest after the initial infection, and without treatment, it can progress over a period of one to two years to more severe forms, leading to significant disability and complications.
Societal Impact:

Prevalence Among the Poor: Leprosy was more prevalent among poor communities, often due to living conditions that facilitated the spread of the disease and a lack of access to medical care.
Misdiagnosis: In a medieval setting, without a clear understanding of the disease and its transmission, leprosy could easily be misdiagnosed initially as a less severe skin condition or ignored until it became unmistakably severe.
Stigma: Leprosy carried a significant stigma, often leading to the isolation of affected individuals in "leper colonies" or other forms of social exclusion.
Given your narrative needs, leprosy could serve as a historical basis for Molly's disease, aligning with your description of a condition that is difficult to diagnose correctly, leads to disfigurement and extreme pain, and ultimately results in death if untreated. You could fictionalize aspects of the disease's transmission, symptoms, and progression to better fit the story you're crafting around Rose and Molly's experience in the medieval setting of Port Aldshore.
