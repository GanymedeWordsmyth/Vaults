Any who approach Dormin's Rest
 
At the center of a long hallway sits an unassuming stone slab about waist high on top of small, round boulder with a flattened top and bottom. The high walls in this hallway are massive statues of different beasts, some quadrupedal, some winged, some bipedal, and some with fins. Any who approach steps into this shrine perched in the direct center of a small desert hears a disembodied voice that speaks with two voices at once, a male and female voice, who appears to be curious as to what the adventurer(s) is doing in such a place. The voice offers to give the adventurer(s) untold power (enough power to rival the Gods) in exchange for finding the voice's 16 other facets scattered within this plane and returning them to the slab.
 
The statues that are seen throughout the shrine are the forms guarding the voice's pieces
 
On the stone slab sits an object that points to the nearest facet. When in proximity to a facet, the object then points towards Diven's Rest
