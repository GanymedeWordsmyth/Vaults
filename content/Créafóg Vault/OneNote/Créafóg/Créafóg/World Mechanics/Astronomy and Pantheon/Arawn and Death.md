Most catacombs are in the shape of the Pluto Symbol.  
If space is limited, like that in small forts, then they are in the shape of an Ankh.
 
King Arawn protector of the dead and watcher over the otherworld, Annwn.  
Ankou is a title that gets passed down to the last death of the year in a region. An Ankou is a watcher over the dead.  
Every Ankou gets a small **[staff]** of psychopomps to help deliver the dead to King Arawn  
The White Lady, Dryad queen of lies and deceit, matron of undeath, and pissed off that she no longer receives humanoid sacrifices, has tricked King Arawn into trapping the current Ankou, forcing them into servitude without being allowed to pass on themselves. Now she uses them to trap followers into servitude of her own.  
The Ankou will give messages to a potential acolyte of death (Grave domain) to follow them to King Arawn, unbeknownst to them, the Ankou are actually delivering the acolytes to the White Lady.
