- Eroding Reality: Characters struggle to differentiate between reality and their hallucinations, affecting decision-making and perception. Disadvantage extends to Intelligence checks and saving throws.
- Ethereal Interactions: Increased ability to interact with the Ethereal Plane, potentially attracting unwanted attention from its denizens. Characters might occasionally become invisible or intangible to those around them, leading to confusion and isolation.
- ~~Triggered effect: when [insert trigger happens], the creature's next long rest brings horrid nightmares, as though under the dream spell. Make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 psychic damage upon waking. Make another [Wisdom] saving throw to gain the benefit of a long rest. Make one final [Wisdom] saving throw to gain the benefit of a short rest. Note: succeed on 1:take no damage, gain benefit of long rest. Fail on 1 succeed on 2: take 3d6, gain benefit of long rest. fail on 1 and 2, succeed on 3, take 3d6 and gain benefits of short rest only, fail all 3: take 3d6, gain no benefit of rest. Additionally, a creature that fails this roll is under the effects of a [___] spell for X minutes.~~
- Soul Displacement: when [insert trigger happens], the creature experiences a soul displacement, where the creature's soul desynchronizes from their body, physically manifesting in the world next to them. The character suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that require precise understanding of positional awareness. This represents the difficulty in reconciling the visual input from two perspectives: their physical body and their displaced soul. Conversely, this effect grants advantage to the character on saving throws against attacks and effects that target them directly, as their dual perspective and shifting presence confound opponents' attempts to pinpoint their exact location.
