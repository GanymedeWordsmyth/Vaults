Grim, Kithri, Smoke  
A warehouse detonates as three individuals are hurled out of one of the windows. One of the individuals slammed into a tree, upside down. The short, bare-chested dwarf with a blazing red mohawk, friendly muttons chops, and bulging muscles rights himself from his completely inverted landing and pours himself some frothy brew from a personal sized keg he carries on his hip into his wooden cup and offers some to his companions. The tall one, an all black anthropomorphic panther with large red-orange rimmed, yellow eyes, shaggy black and gold-trimmed robes and a large tome at his side, sits up and graciously accepts the drink.  
"Ah yez, dis pleases 'im greatly. Many tanks, Greem!" Exclaims the tall cat. He speaks slowly and methodically.  
A feminine voice enters the dwarf's mind also accepting the drink, "Ay Kithri, we tolk't about this. Use ya werds there lassy! Ya know that meks me feel uneaseh!" The dwarf's words, by contrast, are quicker and more clumsy.  
"Right. Sorry." A short girl sits up after sliding across the ground behind the cat. She looks to be no older than 12 or 13, with a war-painted face and tattooed arms, long braided golden, brown hair and earthy green- and red-toned traveler's clothes. In her hand is an axe as tall as she. "That was certainly fun though. Wasn't it?" She says breathing deeply trying to catch her breath.  
"Oh-aye itwas, but Ah lost me best brew back there." After a moment, "Ah well, looks lahk Ah'll just 'afta start anew."  
"Disawun waz lookeen forwart to tasting dis new batch, too. Dey be getting bett'r each time. But now 'im suggests dat a-we geta moving beforre anyone finds us herre, eh?"  
**They all agree, stand up and start off.** The dwarf is given a stern stare from one of the passersby as Kithri finishes the beer from her wooden cup and hooks it back to her belt, "Mind yer own, she's no' a child, ya dafty!" He says shaking his fist. ~~Kithri's voice enters his mind once more as she hooks her cup,~~ "Calm, Grim. There aren't many **Ryn** in these parts."  
"Dis es trrue. Remember Grim, she may be a **Ryn**, but she still looks like a human kid"  
"B'careful saying that there lad, she's likeleh ta kick yer arse fer callin'er such" he says giving her a wink, "Let's goo get yer pup and move ta the next paert of the assignment."
 
Gizmo, Nym, and Ghost - Needs a rewrite

- Gizmo and Nym lament over a shoddy meal when the warehouse detonates. The trio make their way over to check it out. 
Somewhere close by in a rundown shack sits two with their pet rabbit, eating. The pair look to be human children, a boy no older than 4 and a girl no older than 6, both with natted hair and ragged clothing, the brown speckled golden rabbit has big floppy ears, a puffed white furred chest and a long, thin horn spiraling out from the top of its head.  
"Brother, I'm not sure how much longer we can keep doing this. We need to find some kind of permanent abode." She hands a scrap to the bunny. "What do you think Ghost?" The cottontail solemnly takes the morsel in its little hands and chomps hungrily. "See? Even Ghost is hungry."  
"Oh I know dear sister. Ever since we came to this blasted place, it's been one hardship after another." He looks down at his broken plate and traces the edges of a chipped cup of water that they are sharing. "I miss home."  
"I know brother, I'm sorry I wasn't trying to---"  
Dhoommmmmm! A loud, low pitch rumble reverberates through the ground, a shockwave quickly follows the blast and blows out the last bits of windows and glass still remaining.  
_Boooom_ ~~a flash of fiery light flares followed quickly by the canorous cacophony of crashing wood as something nearby detonates discharging a stately (weighty) shock wave sheering shingles and shattering shelters (wasting/wiping out).~~ **[Need better alliterative words]**
 
Ghost skitters away as the two brace against the wall. Afterwards, they hurry to an already busted out window shattered further from the blast wave facing the direction the explosion came from.
 
From here, the two gather Ghost and make their way towards the commotion and are met with a large crowd gathering around a fulminated warehouse
       

Ki, Church, and Shava Galanodel

- This group arrives by boat when the warehouse detonates and the boat is held at bay. No ships are allowed to dock while the investigation is underway. A small dingy floats from ship to ship to triage those waiting to enter.
- Ki tries to talk his way to enterring the city with his companions
- Shava has a conversation with a sourceless voice (the demon in her shadow) 
While approaching the city by boat, a large explosion is seen on the docks and called out by the crow's nest. The Captain calls for the ship to stall docking, but with some careful wording, and some extra coin, Ki is able to convince the Captain to continue as planned.  
The group is approaching the city via the docks near the warehouse that exploded.
    

Grim, Kithri, Smoke

- Arrive back to collect they're payment.
    
    - What were they hired to get? Does it matter? Maybe just have them throw down a sack?
    - Who hired them? The Curator being the hirer may put some tension between this group and the group sent by the Grip

"Oi! We foand tha' thing y'er wantin'. Ya got our pay?"
