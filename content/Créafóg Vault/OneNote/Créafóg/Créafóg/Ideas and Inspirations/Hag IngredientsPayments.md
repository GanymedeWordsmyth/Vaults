Man's first grey  
Stone that holds a bit of the sky  
Part/Bit of the eye of a grand maelstrom  
Snowflakes from the first fall of the year  
Petals of flowers left on the graves of loved ones  
Toys and comforts left behind by a child reaching adolescence  
Memories  
Shards of sunlight/moonlight/etc
