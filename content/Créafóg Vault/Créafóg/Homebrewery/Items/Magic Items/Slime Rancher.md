This item, called the Slime Rancher, is a backpack equipped with a hose and a gun. Point the gun at an ooze creature and pull the trigger. The ooze must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be safely pulled into the rancher. The rancher can hold only one ooze at a time, entrapping it indefinitely. To release an entrapped ooze, push the trigger in the opposite direction. When the rancher contains an ooze, the trigger is locked and must be returned to its original position to release the ooze.
