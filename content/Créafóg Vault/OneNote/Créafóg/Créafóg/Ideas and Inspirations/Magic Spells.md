Summon Lich  
9th level Necromancy  
Casting Time: 1 minute  
Range: 60 feet  
Components: V, S  
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour  
You open a gate and pull a powerful Lich through it. It arrives in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, and disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.  
The lich is compelled to serve you for the duration at the best of its abilities.  
If your Concentration is broken before the spell ends, the Lich doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the Lich.  
If you maintain this spell for the whole hour, you can't use this spell again before a week has passed.
 
Liches are immune to charm. And once said lich reforms they would hunt you down and murder you in ways that don't even have words to describe.
