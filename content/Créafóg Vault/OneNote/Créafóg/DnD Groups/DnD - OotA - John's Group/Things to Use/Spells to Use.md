**Touch of Madness** (Complete Divine 3.5e 184)  
Enchantment 2  
Components: V, S  
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: Touch  
Duration: 1 round/level
 
You may daze one living creature by making a successful  
touch attack. If the target creature does not make a successful  
Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for  
1 round per caster level. A dazed creature is not stunned  
(so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it canâ€™t  
move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.
