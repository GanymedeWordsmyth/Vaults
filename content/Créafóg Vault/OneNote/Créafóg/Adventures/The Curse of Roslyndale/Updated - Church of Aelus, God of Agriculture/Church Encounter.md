Going into the church at night:
 
Order of operations:  
Vestibule, sanctuary door is the only thing that's not old and decrepit.  
Sanctuary encounter  
Leaving the sanctuary, hear a soft humming  
Residual Priest haunting (3d10 necrotic to only one character)  
Leave pastor's office and hear children laughing and playing, beckoning them to play hide and seek  
If they follow, they are lead into a trap.  
Children's bodies disolv into blue flames and attack  
Nun encounter telling them to go to the graveyard.  
**If at any point they return to the sanctuary, the sanctuary encounter replays from the beginning**
 
Sanctuary encounter:  
You come to a large **[locked]** elegantly carved door. Contrary to the surroundings, this door looks to be as bright and new as the day it was finished and installed.
 
You place the key you found into the lock and it turns freely and the door opens into the church's sanctuary. As you walk in, you all see an elegant arrangement of marble columns and granite surfaces. The walls are outlined with a fine golden trim. Cherry wood pews line the atrium up to the raised dais framed by a low white ash wood fence and upon the dais sits an alter in the middle and a lectern on the left and right sides. Above the dais is a tall stain glass dome depicting **[insert deity here**] through which the sun shines brilliantly, bouncing off the lightly colored walls and golden trim lighting the interior.
 
For Allanon and Cleetuhs, you smell and faint smell of ozone as a woman **[Eleanor Cotton]** approaches you, "That was very kind of you to join us for the funeral during this time of morning. Come, come. Sit with me and my husband. Are you friends of Mistress Lackman?" **[take a few minutes to rp this out a bit]** As you talk, she leads you over to one of the pews where a man sits near the middle. "Henry **[Cotton]**," she says to the man quietly as he stares solemnly towards the woman in black, not acknowledging his wife, "these are friends of the Lackman family, Allanon, Cleetuhs, Damp√©, and Roscey. They've come to pay their respects." **[even if they don't call themselves friends, she still says they are. Also, she still introduces everyone even if they didn't all follow.]**
 
The pastor continues his speech as you look around and see a few other villagers. In the front row is the woman you met from earlier sitting in a black veil and dress. Next to her sits a man dressed in a well made suit **[this is the same man from Dampe's dream]**. What do you do?
