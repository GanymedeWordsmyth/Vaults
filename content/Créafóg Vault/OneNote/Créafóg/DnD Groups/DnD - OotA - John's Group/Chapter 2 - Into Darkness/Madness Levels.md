Madness levels increase when:

- Characters spend at least eight consecutive hours in a faerzress infused area (this includes a long rest)
- A character takes psychic damage, and has disadvantage when in a faerzress infused area
- The characters witness something particularly alien or disturbing
- Eating spoiled meat
- Spending too much time in the dark/not being able to see (24 consecutive hours?)
