Thank you for the clarification. Let's adjust Mr. Cotton's backstory accordingly:
 
### Revised Backstory of Mr. Cotton:
 
In your world, Mr. Cotton's plight as a sorcerer is marked by a poignant twist of fate involving his connection to the Lackman family.
 
### Fleeing Persecution:
 
As a sorcerer in a world where such individuals are ruthlessly hunted by the witch hunters of the Sovereign Concordat, Mr. Cotton lived a life overshadowed by the constant threat of discovery. His innate magical powers made him a target in a world where sorcery was not just feared but actively eradicated.
 
### Refuge with Heward Lackman:
 
In his desperate search for sanctuary, Mr. Cotton turned to an old friend, Mr. Heward Lackman. Heward, possibly unknown to his wife, offered Cotton refuge, understanding the dangers he faced as a sorcerer. This act of kindness allowed Cotton to assume a new identity in Roslyndale, living under the guise of a local wizard.
 
### The Twist of Fate:
 
This safe haven, however, became the ground for a tragic turn of events. After Heward Lackman's (possible) demise, his wife, Mistress Westra Lackman, overwhelmed by grief after losing her children to a plague, inadvertently entangled Cotton in her desperate quest for their resurrection. Unaware of his true nature as a sorcerer and his vulnerable position, she blackmailed him into attempting a spell beyond his capabilities.
 
### The Catastrophic Ritual:
 
Under the duress of blackmail and the weight of his own secret, Cotton attempted the resurrection ritual. His failure led to the catastrophic event that cursed Roslyndale â€“ a shocking outcome that was as much a result of his hidden identity as it was of the tragic circumstances he found himself in.
 
### Cotton's Connection to the Lackman Tragedy:
 
In this context, Mr. Cotton's story is deeply intertwined with the Lackman family's tragedy. His past as a sorcerer seeking refuge with Heward Lackman adds layers of complexity and irony to the narrative, painting him as a tragic figure whose attempt to escape a dangerous world inadvertently led to the creation of another.
