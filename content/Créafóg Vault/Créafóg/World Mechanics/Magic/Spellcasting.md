`Casting spells should be exhausting. You are bending the fabric of reality to your whims and that should be represented.

When you cast a spell, make a saving throw using your spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is equal to three times the spell level you are casting. Failure gains a level of exhaustion, failing by more that 5 gains 2 levels. Rolling a natural 1 increases the tier of failure by 1 i.e. if your roll succeeds by less than 5 and you rolled a natural 1, you gain a level of exhaustion instead of being fatigued. Succeeding on this save fatigues the caster, unless they save by more than 5. A natural 20 means they don't use the slot regardless of spell level (including level 9). Note: a natural 20 doesn't necessarily mean that the caster succeeds by more than 5 and may still be fatigued.

Spellcasters that prepare spells have access to the full spell list/spell book. Prepared spells are further empowered. When casting a prepared spell, that spell acts as though it were cast with the next spell slot
	~~choose a numerical aspect of the spell and multiply that by your proficiency bonus.~~ 
	I need some kind of rule to empower spells that doesn't overpower some spells, while underpowering others.
	Okay, what if the empowerment as an upcast. Any prepared spell, when cast, acts as though it was cast using one spell slot above.
