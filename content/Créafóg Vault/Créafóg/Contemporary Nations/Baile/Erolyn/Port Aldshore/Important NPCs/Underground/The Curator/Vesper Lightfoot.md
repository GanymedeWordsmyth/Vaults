Background: A thief turned spy for the city, Vesper's network of contacts and secrets died with him. His persona imbues the Curator with cunning, stealth, and a web of informants.

Appearance: The embodiment of stealth and secrecy, Vesper has a lithe, agile frame suitable for sneaking and espionage. His attire would be nondescript yet functional, with hidden pockets for tools and trinkets. A shadowy cloak or hood would help him blend into the darkness.

Voice: Vesper's voice is soft and smooth, with a sly undertone that hints at secrets untold. It's flexible, able to blend into the background or rise with sharp wit, always measuring his words to suit his audience and situation.
