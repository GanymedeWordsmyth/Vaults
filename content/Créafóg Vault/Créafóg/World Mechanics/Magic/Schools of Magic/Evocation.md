Control
	Narrative Essence: Control spells are the mastery over the natural elements and forces, bending wind, water, earth, and fire to the caster's will. Practitioners of these spells are seen as elemental conductors, orchestrating the very fabric of the natural world to respond to their command.
	Expanded Somatic Component: Fluid movements that mimic the nature of the element being controlled, such as a sweeping motion for wind, a rising gesture for earth, or a flick for fire. The caster becomes the embodiment of the element, their movements a dance that directs its power.
	Expanded Verbal Component: Commands that resonate with the primal essence of the element, spoken in a language as old as the earth itself. Each word vibrates with power, a call to action that the element cannot ignore.
	Complex Sigil: Elemental symbols (fire, water, air, earth) intertwined in a dynamic pattern, representing the unity and command over natural forces.
	Deeper Color Meaning: A spectrum of colors representing each element, but predominantly orange for its association with energy and transformation.
