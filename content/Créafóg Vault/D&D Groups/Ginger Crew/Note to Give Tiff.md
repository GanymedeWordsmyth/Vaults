Session 1:
	Midsummer
	First day was spent RPing and getting into character, clock not ticking
	Slept into second day: trying to find Randy Powers
	Town guard doesn't really care about the dwarf pulling out his member.
		Pulling out your member only becomes a problem when you insult someone of nobility. In the area of the common folk, it is only a problem when the receiving person pulls a blade outâ€¦which Pockets did. And Thick attempted to impersonate a reeve.
		Thick successfully talked his way out of arrest, but Pockets still pulled out a blade so will need to answer for that.
			If Pockets is arrested, it'll increase his possibility of being reported to Fawnlear
	Brigsby is the old halfling that sells navigator's tools
	
Session 2:
	Second day found randy at the Dapper Dolphin where he seemed to attack Esvele Tallstag, the owner and his boss
	At the end of the day, they witnessed the fireworks over Fort Strongwater
	Third day met up with Galvyn McFerghuson, head of waste management entrance 2, and went into the sewers
	Fought a croc, Caelynn almost died =[
	At the end of the fight, Pockets saw someone peak around the corner, give a wry smile and a hush finger, then dart away.

Session 3:
	Pockets got a migraine at the bathhouse
	Caelynn got a migraine at the apothecary
	Thikk never got a migraine
