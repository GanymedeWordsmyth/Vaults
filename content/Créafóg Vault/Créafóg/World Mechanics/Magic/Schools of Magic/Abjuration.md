	Expanded Somatic Component: The caster's movements are deliberate, setting the boundaries with broad strokes in the air that delineate the protected area. Each line drawn is a barrier, a refusal to allow passage.
	Expanded Verbal Component: A deep, resonating chant that speaks of ancient gates and walls that have stood unbreached for eons. The words are a declaration, setting the law of what may enter and what must remain outside.
	Complex Sigil: A fortress wall with a gate, surrounded by protective runes. It signifies not just defense but the right of passage, the discernment between friend and foe.
	Deeper Color Meaning: Steel gray, embodying the unyielding nature of metal and stone, the material from which bulwarks are built and maintained against all odds.
