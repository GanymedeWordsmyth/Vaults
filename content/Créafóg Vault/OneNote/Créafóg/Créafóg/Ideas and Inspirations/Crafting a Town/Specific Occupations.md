*Foot notes:  
Barber-Chirurgeon. Barbers were the barbers, dentist, and surgeon all in one. A barber's responsibilities included, blood-letting and leeching, neck manipulation, cupping, extraction of teeth, draining boils and fistula, ear-cleaning, enemas, haircutting, hairdressing, lancing cysts with wicks to draw out the fluid  
nail clipping, scalp-cleaning and massage, shaving, and surgery. Ships going to war or on long sea voyages would have their own Barber-Chirurgeon. These "Ship's Barbers" had one extra responsibility - triage.
