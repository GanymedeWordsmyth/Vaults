When creating a human druid:
	Backstory Core Elements:
		**Mentorship:** Your character was mentored by a respected wood elf druid, known for their wisdom and connection to the natural world. This mentor saw potential in you, despite the rarity of human druids, and chose you as a protégé.
		**Education and Training:** Druidism for you was not just an apprenticeship but an academic pursuit. You attended structured classes alongside other proteges, which were held in various natural sanctuaries, sometimes accessed through the astral plane to reach secluded grottos dedicated to druidic teachings.
		**Courtly Influence:** Although you were not directly in the court's service, your training under a court druid exposed you to the political and social intricacies of high society. This unique perspective allowed you to understand the balance between nature and civilization, influencing your approach to druidic magic and its applications.
	Character Development Suggestions:
		**Nature vs. Nurture:** Explore the tension between your human heritage and the wood elf-influenced teachings. How does this duality affect your relationship with nature and the druidic circles?
		**Magic Lineage:** Considering that humans in Baile learn magic from other races, think about how your character views this exchange of knowledge. Is there a desire to prove oneself, or perhaps an ambition to blend human innovation with traditional druidic practices?
		**Role in Society:** Reflect on your character's place within the world's social fabric. Having been a protégé of a court druid, how does your character reconcile the reverence typically afforded to druids with their outsider status as a human in this mystical discipline?
		**Adventures and Learning:** Your character's journey can involve seeking out ancient druidic sites, hidden within the folds of the astral plane, as part of ongoing education and mastery of nature magic. These quests can also serve as rites of passage, earning your place among the revered druids of Baile.
	Character Hooks and Quest Ideas
		**Ancient Grottoes:** Your mentor sends you on a quest to a long-forgotten grotto to recover a piece of ancient wisdom or a powerful artifact. This journey tests your skills and deepens your connection to the natural world.
		**Diplomatic Balance:** A conflict arises that threatens a delicate balance between human settlements and the natural order. Your unique background positions you as a mediator, using your druidic knowledge and courtly insights to find a harmonious resolution.
		**Astral Wonders and Perils:** An adventure leads you and your party into the astral plane, navigating its wonders and dangers to restore or protect a vital natural sanctuary that sustains the balance in the material world.
