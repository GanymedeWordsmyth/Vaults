Projects
Starting with practical projects is a great way to apply and reinforce my learning in C++ and cybersecurity, especially with a focus on embedded systems. Here are some project ideas that range from beginner to more advanced levels. These projects can help me understand core concepts, develop my coding skills, and get hands-on experience with security practices.
C++ Projects
Console-Based Applications: Begin with simple console applications to strengthen my understanding of C++ syntax and logic. Examples include a calculator, a to-do list manager, or a text-based game. These projects can help me get comfortable with variables, loops, conditionals, and basic data structures.
File Handling Projects: Work on projects that involve reading from and writing to files, such as a simple database system where I can store, retrieve, and manipulate data. This introduces me to handling file streams and data serialization in C++.
Data Structure Implementations: Implement various data structures from scratch like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. This will deepen my understanding of algorithms and memory management.
Simple Encryption/Decryption Tool: Create a tool that can encrypt and decrypt text files using basic algorithms like Caesar cipher or more complex ones as I get more comfortable. This introduces me to the concepts of cryptography, which is foundational in cybersecurity.
Embedded Systems Projects
 Get a cheap breadboard kit
LED Blinking Program: Start with the basics of embedded programming by controlling an LED with a microcontroller like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. This project teaches me about microcontroller programming and I/O operations.
Temperature Sensor Data Logger: Use a temperature sensor to collect data and log it either to a file or display it in real-time on a small screen. This project can introduce me to sensor integration, data collection, and possibly networking concepts if I decide to send data over the internet.
Home Automation System: Develop a simple home automation system using microcontrollers and sensors. I could start with automating lights based on motion sensors or time of day, and scale up to more complex scenarios.
Cybersecurity Projects
Set Up a Home Lab: Create a safe, controlled environment on my computer or a separate machine where me can practice cybersecurity concepts. Use virtual machines to set up different operating systems and experiment with tools like Wireshark for network analysis or Metasploit for vulnerability testing.
Vulnerability Analysis of an Application: Choose an open-source application or software, study its codebase, and try to identify security vulnerabilities. This will help me understand common security issues in software development and how to mitigate them.
Network Monitoring Tool: Develop a simple tool to monitor network traffic, looking for anomalies or specific patterns that could indicate suspicious activity. This could involve learning to use and script for existing network analysis tools.
Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges: Engage in CTF challenges available on platforms like CTFtime or Hack The Box. These challenges can range from network security, cryptography, web exploitation, and more. They are an excellent way to apply and test my knowledge in real-world scenarios.
Getting Started
Select a Project: Start with a project that matches my current skill level. Initially, aim for completion rather than complexity.
Plan My Approach: Break the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Plan my approach to each task, researching as necessary.
Learn and Iterate: Don’t worry about getting everything perfect on the first try. Learning from mistakes and iterating on my solutions is a key part of the process.
Document My Work: Keep a record of what I learn, challenges I face, and how me overcome them. This documentation can be valuable for future reference and showcasing my projects to potential employers or collaborators.

Remember, the goal of these projects is to build my skills progressively. Don't hesitate to start simple and gradually take on more complex challenges as me grow more comfortable with the concepts and tools.

Advice
Affordable bachelors programs. Recommended to get at least a bachelors so I don’t get taken advantage of. - Sean
	The American Society of Quality Certified Quality Engineer cert is pricy( get a sponsor), but the value in what you will learn is applicable everywhere. Not directly applicable but will give you an edge in terms of “do good, fix problems, analyze data”. (not cyber -emily)
They also have a cert in software quality.

Emily’s notes:
Security+ is technically considered a golden ticket if you’re trying to get into the government contract side of cybersecurity (at least for NUWC/Naval Station Newport). It’s a good starter certification to get, especially if you do not have a formal degree in it
RMF (Risk Management Framework) is also a good thing to be versed on if you prefer to go the Infomation Assurance route. (NIST 800-53 https://stigviewer.com/controls/800-53 ). The NIST security controls also kinda show up on the Security+ test. Basic understanding of these are helpful for the test
C++ is very helpful to know, also if you do pursue the Linux route, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is usually the go-to Linux OS in the defense industry. Their certs can be a bit pricey but having a basic knowledge if Linux’s language is always good to have.
Definitely think the learning path you got set up is very good & in depth with the basics of cybersecurity. There’s many different paths in the field you can take; the cyber field is always going to have more positions than people to fill them. 
*sparkle* all morals go out the window when you get that first paycheck from a defense contractor *sparkle*
