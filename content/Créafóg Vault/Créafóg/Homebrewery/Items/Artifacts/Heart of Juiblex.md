## Avatar of [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm)
Adjusting the "final stand" ability at psi=1.0 to be more [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm)-themed, we can emphasize the chaotic, corrupting, and oozing nature of [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm), reflecting its dominion over slimes, oozes, and the abyssal forces of decay and destruction. Here's a reimagined version that captures these themes:

Threshold of Consummation (Ψ = 1.0): Avatar of [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm)
Abyssal Reckoning: [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] can invoke the full might of [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm), transforming into an Avatar of the Abyss. This transformation grants her control over slimes and oozes, the ability to secrete and manipulate corrosive acids, and to spread decay at a touch. She becomes a nexus of abyssal corruption, able to summon oozes, unleash waves of acidic destruction, and terrify foes with her mere presence.

Abilities as the Avatar:
Abyssal Command: Gain the ability to summon and control any ooze creatures within a significant radius, bending them to her will.
Corrosive Aura: An aura of acid surrounds her, damaging enemies who get too close and dissolving non-magical objects on contact.
Decay Touch: Her touch can corrupt and decay organic matter, withering away life force and potentially transforming living beings into oozelike minions.
Slimeform Mastery: Full control over her form allows her to assume various ooze-like shapes, gaining abilities such as engulfing enemies, splitting into multiple forms, and regenerating from damage.

Risks and Consequences:
Abyssal Corruption: Using this power risks [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]]'s permanent transformation into a servant of [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm), losing her autonomy and potentially becoming a new source of corruption in the world.
Environmental Blight: The land around where she uses this power may become a blighted, ooze-infested wasteland, a lasting scar upon the natural world.
Psychic Strain: The mental strain of wielding such power threatens to fracture [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]]'s psyche, making it difficult to return to her former self even if she can resist [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm)'s dominion.

Managing the Risk
Abyssal Resistance: Before reaching Ψ = 1.0, [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] and her allies might seek ways to resist or mitigate the corrupting influence, such as artifacts known to protect against abyssal corruption or powerful allies capable of pulling her back from the brink.
Cleansing Rituals: Should [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] succumb to or flirt with the abyssal transformation, powerful cleansing rituals, possibly involving sacrifices or quests for rare components, could be necessary to restore her or at least stave off the corruption's worst effects.
Narrative Impact: This transformation could serve as a climactic moment in the campaign, with significant ramifications for [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]], her party, and the world. It could be a desperate gambit to turn the tide in a critical battle or a tragic fall that the party strives to reverse.By making the "final stand" ability deeply [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm)-themed, you emphasize the gravity of [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]]'s pact with the Heart of [Juiblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#juiblex_mpmm), setting the stage for dramatic narrative developments and challenging moral dilemmas.
