# Who is Our Lady in Agony
## Background
Our Lady in Agony, driven by her insatiable thirst for power and vengeance against those who wronged her, delved deep into the forbidden arts of blood magic. In her relentless pursuit of greater power, she performed a dark ritual within her demesne, seeking to harness the life force of her enemies to fuel her own strength.

However, the ritual went horribly awry. The energies unleashed by her blood magic spiraled out of control, engulfing her demesne in flames and consuming the once-lush forests with searing heat. The very land itself seemed to scream in agony as it was ravaged by the inferno, leaving behind a desolate landscape of charred trees and smoldering embers.

Now, Our Lady in Agony finds herself ruling over a domain wreathed in perpetual fire and suffering, a grim reflection of her own twisted desires and the destructive power of her blood magic. The flames that engulf her demesne serve as a constant reminder of the price she paid for her lust for power, fueling her insatiable thirst for vengeance against those she blames for her torment.
