# Player Primer  
Welcome to Baile during the Dawn of Man. For many, many millennia, the prime material plane has been home to a vast number of species: Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, and Sylvans, to name a few. Throughout early history, most of the races have seen humans as nothing more than intelligent animals to be used in labor and breeding, as the human race seems to be able to do so with any race, creating crossbreeds that last longer and are more durable than other humans and the race of which their other half is a part.
 
Within the last six centuries the humans have become fed up with this treatment. Some of them have taken a stand against this slavery. With the help of the elves, who never saw fit to enslave them in the first place, certain humans were gifted with the knowledge of the Weave. Those under the care of the Highborn Elves learned to perform magic through long hours of study and sheer power of will. These became the first humans wizards. Those under the guidance of the Woodland Elves were taught the chaotic ebb and flow of nature and became the first human druids. Over time it has been seen that humans have a natural aptitude for magic and are able to innately sense when a magical presence is near.
 
## Something Different  
Classes and races are seen a little differently in this world than in the world of Faerûn. The following is information on how the world of Créafóg is viewed by its inhabitants.  
### Important human class information.  
###### (Common names and pronunciations are provided in parentheses)  
#### Druids:  
A druid's grotto is in a pocket dimension of the astral plane, hence why they are so difficult to find. Druids are highly revered spell casters and as such are commonly seen in the court of most high ranking officials and nobility.  
#### Wizards: (Saoi; pr. SEE)  
Saois are the researchers and scientists that push development forward. These are commonly seen sitting next to high nobility.  
#### Clerics:  
In their study, some humans saw the Weave as a way to commune with their deities. Those who have successfully done so have become clerics. These humans carry out day to day chores of their respective deities.  
```  
```  
#### Paladins: (Misneach; pr MISH-nock)  
Certain clerics have taken it on themselves to spread the word of their particular deities, becoming misneach. The Misneach are seen as knights and enforcers of the laws of man. The Misneach and Centaurs often have a relative peace so they can maintain balance between civilization and nature, as Centaurs are the keepers of the chaotic element of nature.  
#### Bards: (Scéal; pr shkayle; Ceol; pr kyol)  
Those that have figured out how to infuse their words and songs with the Weave have become scéals and ceols, respectively. They are responsible for spreading the words of new laws and other news. What they sing is believed unquestioningly as Bards tend to have unwavering morals.  
#### Sorcerers:  
Just before the third attempt to escape enslavement completely, the human druids and wizards worked together tirelessly to create a human infused with the power of the Weave. Three centuries it took to finally create such a being. This being was called a sorcerer, named after the elven word sorcer, meaning infusion. Sorcerers that were created and infused with the forces of nature are Wild Mages. The wizards and druids had also found a way to infuse humans with the Weave through the use of Dragon blood, opening up the Draconic Bloodline. Once created, sorcerers were the keystone in the humans gaining their independence from the oppressive races. Now that the war for independence is over, creation of sorcerers is no longer necessary. Modern sorcerers are now seen as abominations and are feared for their innate ability to pull at the threads of the Weave.  
#### Misc:  
There are also those who have been able to use the Weave for their own ends and have split off from the original classes. All classes have a mix of druidic and wizardly influences.
 
### Human reactions to other races  
#### Tieflings  
Word has spread from town to town that death and destruction follows in the wake of a the demon spawn known as tieflings. If there is a tiefling in your town, it's time to move, far, far away.  
#### Dragonborn  
During the time of the Saoirse (SEER-sha), the deities, themselves, had come down in the form of shimmering humans of different metallic colors. They, along with the elves and a few other races helped to fight off the dragons and the humanoid kin of various colors that were enslaving the human race. Since the time of the great war, these chromatic dragons and dragonkin were fought off and are largely believed to have been destroyed entirely.

# On the topic of Player Races of Créafóg
 
## Tieflings  
### Background  
Many millennia ago, a small tear between dimensions had occurred between Créafóg and the Nine Hells. It took the Nine Hells a very long time to find it as it doesn’t let anything through very quickly. At some point a Greater devil named Alastor the Grim was able to come through, however. This pitfiend bided his time and eventually was able to pull lesser devils through; and together they started stealing the children from the nearby towns in the lush plains surrounding the tear. These children were forced into slavery. Shortly thereafter, the devils began construction on a ziggurat that they plan to use to open the tear into a gate so they can pull through the rest of the Nine Hells into and dominate Créafóg. Over the millennia since their arrival, they crossbred the humans with the devils, which slowly warped the humans form into what are now known as tieflings. There is a very strict hierarchy in caring for the ziggurat and the tieflings are the lowest in it, even lower than lemures. The ziggurat and portal has pulled over immense power from the land surrounding it, turning the once lush plains into what is now a desolate desert. A watchful eye is kept on the tieflings when they are not working on expanding the portal and caring for the ziggurat. Only a handful have ever escaped and are now hunted by the devils that once held them captive.   ### How they are viewed by others:  
Word has spread to other towns that death and destruction follows a tiefling, though they believe it's caused by the tieflings themselves. As such, most humans fear the tieflings, some are even hostile towards them, and a few are even willing to risk everything they have to fight them, unprovoked, if it means the possibility of the tiefling leaving without any trouble and saving their family.

## Dragonborn:  
### Background  
A very long time ago when the metallic dragons had roamed the sky, many of them had adopted human servants as family. These humans had tended to the needs of the dragon and shared in its horde. All was calm and serene with the dragons until the corruption of Takhisis started to seep into the inner circle of a few dragon families, secretly converting the humans into her disciples. She taught them a ritual that would corrupt the eggs of the dragons the humans once served and lived with. Driven with perverse greed, many of the humans were able to secretly perform this rite without the dragon's knowledge, turning the eggs into a dark, evil version of their parent. After the eggs finally hatched, the evil and twisted wyrmlings that emerged and, with the help of the humans, killed and ate the metallic parents. After that, they polymorphed into a humanoid form and forcefully mated with the corrupted female human servants and killed off the males. Those woman that didn't die carrying the child were killed giving birth to the chromatic dragonborn race. Thus began their reign of tyranny over the humans.
 
The dragons that had caught on destroyed their human followers and eggs, save for the humans which whom they could see were fighting the corruption, and fled to individual cave systems all across Baile. These humans that remained true were gifted with some of the blood from their dragon master as a sign of thanks and to serve as extra protection against Takhisis' corruption. When the dragons infused the humans with their own blood, they found that it started to change humans' physical form. This change was excruciatingly painful and took the metallic dragons by surprise as they did not know this would happen. They did their best to try and make the humans comfortable while they changed as there was no reversing it.
 
Many millennia past by and the dragonborn population of each dragon had began to grow. Both the chromatics and the metallics. A few attempts were made by the metallic dragons and dragonborn to free the humans from the slavery of the other races. All were met with failures. Then came what the humans now call the Saoirse. The Elves, metallic dragons and dragonborn (appearing as humanoids with a sheen that reflected their ancestry), certain sylvan races, and others had banded together to make one final attempt at freeing the humans from enslavement. It was a long and bloody war that lasted well over six centuries, until finally, they fought off the corrupted chromatic dragons and their kin. That was the first major battle won. Then came the onslaught of the orcs, the evil sylvans, drow, duergar, and even goblins. The fight became more and more intense as the side for humans began winning. Finally, in the eighth century, the humans were completely free. All races fighting for slavery were forced away (the evil elves and dwarves were forced underground and have become what is known as the drow and duergar races, respectively) and those fighting against slavery went back to their respective homes. The metallic dragons and dragonborn could finally go back to their true forms in peace away from the humans.
 
Very few humans knew the true form of these shimmering humans, the rest regarded them as gods that walked this plane fighting for their freedom and survival. Many of those that did know the true form of the dragons have since died off without passing their knowledge. So for the rest of humanity, the metallic dragons had died off and all dragons are regarded as evil since the only dragons they ever saw in the Saoirse were the chromatic ones. Even less knew of the existence of the dragonborn and any human that encounters a dragonborn will instinctually either run or become aggressive towards the monster that stands before them.
 
### Human Reactions  
During the time of the Saoirse, the deities, themselves, had come down in the form of shimmering humans of different metallic colors.

# Regions of Baile: A note to DMs  
After the Saoirse, the humans were given four neighboring regions which are safeguarded against invaders, Nirani in the north, Rybeth to the west, Aladewyr to the east, and Erolyn to the South. The humans have been given one thousand years to make their claim on the world before that safeguard is lifted completely.
 
There are many who would see the humans back in slavery and give the humans no end of trouble. Every region has its own challenges to work through. Ask your players in which region they would like to play. Feel free to give a short, vague synopsis that will catch their attention.
 
###### > Tier 1 party to start. Environment levels with the characters  
###### > Each region will describe major plot areas as well as minor plot areas  
###### > After the initial introductory plot, the party will be given choices as to where the wish to go next. The direction they chose not to pursue will have guidelines for what develops while the party is elsewhere.

## Baloratukkin  
Thusly named after the lush, green rolling hills on which it stands, Baloratukkin, translated to the common tongue as green skin, is the single most strongest fortress in the orcish society. It is said that Luthic came to the Prime Material Plane long ago and created this stronghold to prevent her orcish children from fighting themselves to extinction. By no means a safe haven, it is still recognized by all orcs on Créafóg as []. After its creation, Baloratukkin was handed to Gruumsh to rule over it, so long as []. After Gruumsh took over, he began calling the fort Gijaklod, meaning blood ridge, after the brutality displayed by his chosen few. Grutok the Brutal, an **Orc War Chief**, sits at the head of the fortress with [], **Orc Blade of Ilneval**, and six **Orc Eyes of Gruumsh** that serve as bodyguards.
 
## Background  
Granny Gretta Greenteeth, an **Annis Hag**, is upset that the humans have carved a path through her precious forest. In an effort to push back the humans, she's devised a way to use the orcs to her advantage. Appearing to them as a Bear Woman, Granny Greenteeth has been whispering in the ears of the orcish cult leaders Shamog Skin Flayer of Bahgtru, Ruhk the Filthy of Yurtrus and Baggi Death Spear of Shargaas. Under this guise, she makes a claim that she and the other Bear Women have received visions from Luthic, herself, that she and the other Gods are unhappy with Grutok the Brutal's current []. Granny claims that to win their god's favor in overthrowing and ruling the Stronghold they must each go out and destroy the human settlements. The first one back will have the strength needed to become the leader.
 
## Arriving at the Fort
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You stand outside Fort Strongwater, a relatively new fort constructed to be a mid point between Fairfield, the capital city of Erolyn, and Port Aldshore. You hear the words of Taoiseach (TEE-shock; meaning leader) Baltair Matanach ring through your mind to stop the sieges against the Fort lead by the orcs. You can see that the fort looks visibly and hurriedly repaired in many areas.
 
Upon entering the fort, you see a few buildings, but many tents as opposed to actual stone and mortar buildings. You get a sense that with all the raids, there hasn't been much time to make a truly permanent structure.  
</div>
 
The party is free to explore the fort as desired. The fort is described on the following page. When the party is finished with there business, they should make their way toward the captain's quarters. The small hovel has two guards posted outside the building. Upon entering the building, the party will see Captain Bhaltaire Gill, a long time war **veteran** having received word of the new arrivals, is waiting patiently for the party to enter along with his scribe Aodh Ciar (pr Eh Keer), sitting at a small map table and a number of **guards** equal to the party size plus four.
