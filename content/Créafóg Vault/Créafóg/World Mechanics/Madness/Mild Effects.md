- Noticeable Strain: Increased anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and mild paranoia. Characters might experience disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws that involve emotional control or fear.
- Hallucinations: Occasional visual or auditory hallucinations that, while not wholly distracting, begin to hint at the character's deteriorating mental state.
- ~~Triggered effect: when [insert trigger happens], the creature makes an Intelligence saving throw or behaves as though under the Phantasmal Force spell. The phantasm takes a random shape. Additionally, a creature that fails this roll is under the effects of a detect magic spell for 10 minutes.~~
- Ethereal Echoes: When triggered, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, they begin hearing dissonant whispers for 1 hour. The whispers distract the creature, imposing disadvantage on concentration checks, perception checks that rely on hearing, and checks to determine the outcome of work done over long periods. Additionally, during this time the creature can choose to listen closely to the whispers and may reroll any one failed ability check, attack roll, or saving throw per long rest. Once the creature uses this, the dissonant whispers cease until the end of the creature's next long rest.
