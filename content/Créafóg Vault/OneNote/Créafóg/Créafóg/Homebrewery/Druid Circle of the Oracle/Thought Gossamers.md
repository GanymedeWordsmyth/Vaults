Do creatures leave them behind everywhere they go?  
Do only particularly strong thoughts form this...."Thought Gossamer"?  
Do creatures immune to having their thoughts read not produce it?
 
Throughout history, many things are thought. Throughout history many thoughts are forgotten. Some even before the thinker realizes the thoughts were ever thought, never to be thought again. Except...what if there was a way to rethink these thoughts? What if there was a way to retrieve them? To relive them? In an incredibly rare instance a particular type of person, a particular type of Druid, just might be able to see these thoughts. Of these very, very few, one might even be able to...tap into these thoughts, experience these thoughts, and even learn from them.
 
The Druid Circle of the Oracle is a subclass that is devoted to learning information from the depths of a place that cannot be reached by common or uncommon means. The minds of those long since passed. As the Druid hones this particular skill, they become far better at gathering information through a silky wisp that floats through the air like a fine spidery thread called a Gossamer left behind by any and all thinking creatures. Image being able to learn about the past by seeing through the eyes of those belonging to that era.
 
My very first homebrew subclass! Let me know what you think. Constructive criticism only please.
 
The idea I was going for is that Gossamers are the little fragments of thought without which make you say, "now what was that again." All thinking creatures leave them about. From something as simple as forgotten bits of your grocery list to more important thoughts like forgetting which hidden book allows you to enter the hidden dungeon rooms beneath your inconspicuous cottage. Creatures immune to having their thoughts read are immune to having their Gossamers plucked from their mind but can still leave them behind if they aren't careful.
 
Thanks to /u/dedicated-pedestrian for helping with the first draft and coming up with the name Gossamer.
