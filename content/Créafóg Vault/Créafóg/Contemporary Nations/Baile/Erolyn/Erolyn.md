[[Fort Strongwater]]


Old notes:
	The people of Erolyn, protected by the forest to the east, has no issue with the hags. Instead they are attempting to create shipping trade, although the sahuagin people of the sea are unhappy. [As are the [Hill People?]?]
	With the constant onslaught of orcs, the Erolians were the first to construct motte-and-bailey castles. It hasnâ€™t yet caught on with the other regions.
	Fort Strongwater. Erolyn is attempting to create another fort, Fort Strongwater. The local [orcs/goblins/bugbears?] have been making this very difficult. [Orc?] children have been known to bully and harass and even kill and pillage passing merchants as a rite of passage. Sometimes enslaving and raping the woman as half-orcs are prized as slave laborers and can be sold for other goods.
	 Granny Gretta Greenteeth is a Annis Hag
	What fighting style is air bending?
