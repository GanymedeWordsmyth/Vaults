Entry Hall  
It's a cloudy day as you step out onto the entry veranda. Sitting at the table, you take a sip of your espresso and watch some movers you hired carry in Heward's bar globe and rolltop desk.

When entering from either the library or the event hall, more spectral dancers can be seen twirling under the moonlight  
Dining Room  
It's a beautiful mid-morning day today as you step out onto the veranda. The tree line in the distance sparkles brilliantly as the morning dew finishes evaporating off their leaves. You see your fountain in your garden in the back and smile as you hear your husband's voice calling from within the house, "I'll be right out darling. Just putting together a little something for Silifrey."
