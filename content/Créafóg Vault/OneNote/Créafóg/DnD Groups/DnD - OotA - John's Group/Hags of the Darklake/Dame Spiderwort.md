Dreams (Fin):

- If Fin actual does any of the stuff Dame Spiderwort wants, should there be a debilitating pain and a brand showing up somewhere to denote that the dreamer's soul now belongs to her? There could be a side quest that allows the dreamer to remove the brand.
- Hemeth, Eldeth, and Jimjar are plotting against you.
- They're planning a mutiny
- After a few sessions, they start to look at the dreamer hungrily.
 
In the bestiary is an entry describing the nightmarish dream state brought about by a night hag. [this is actually the fey realm. Your soul is stolen and brought there] If you ever find yourself in this dream state, you should never eat any food, drink any drink, or accept any gift offered to you for you will then be forever bound to that place. Segue this into a dream session where they have to a) realize they are in a dream and b) find their way out.
