The madness of the demon lords has slowly but sure started to corrupt the hallowed ground of the temple starting from the water level and going upwards
 
**[Does this happen before or after the long rest]:**  
**If after the long rest, it will give the Drow PCs time to devalue the temple, but won't give them the opportunity to get their stuff back before the basement encounter. Also, this will give them an opportunity to go downstairs without Daeg and Belbol. That would be catastrophic.**  
**If before the long rest, it wouldn't give the drow PCs an opportunity to deface the temple, but they also wouldn't have the opportunity to go to the basement alone.**  
**Conclusion: wait until you hear what Fin and Dranu plan to do and make a decision based on that. If they want to go into the basement, switch to Daeg and Belbol's POV and run the encounter. If they don't make for the basement, then give them the long rest first.**
 
**Blights and a Merrow encounter:**
 
Daeg and Belbol, you see some of the dead shrubs start to sway as if with a very windy day, though wind you do not feel. While this happens, a section of vines on the ground swirl and wriggle upwards as they slowly start to form a humanoid figure. This humanoid mass of vines walks into the entrance to the temple. **[Twig blights and a vine blight]** The two shrubs that were swaying uproot and form two legs and follow the mass of vines and follow the vines. **[Wait for Daeg and Belbol to make to go in]** As you make to follow them in you feel something bump forcefully against the bottom of the boat almost capsizing it. **[Wait until Belbol or Daeg check it out]** As you peer over the side of the boat, all is quiet for a moment when suddenly a harpoon juts out of the dark water **[roll an attack roll]**:

- **If it hits:** and attempts to pull you under. Roll contested Str save.
    
    - If the merrow wins, he pulls you close, exclaiming, "the Prince comes for you all," then pulls you under the water 1d4x5 feet away from the boat, makes a bite attack, then goes back for the boat.
- **If it misses:** â€¦and narrowly miss you. A hideous mer creature them jumps out of the water to bite you.

Everyone roll initiative!! **[Either play out initiative in order switching the scene depending on who's up, or keep track of two separate initiative orders and play one round from each scene before switching.]**
 
**Basement encounter:**
 
The basement of the temple is considerably darker than on the main floor **[dim light]** for reasons you can't immediately discern. The ceiling is about fifteen feet tall. There are four more petrified remains here, but this time they are wearing dark leathery cloaks that look relatively new, as if someone had put them on the statues recently. Curiously, the cloaks seem to be too small to fit the statues completely.
 
As you approach the statues, you start to hear haunting moans coming from the statues. **[roll wisdom saving throw]**. Those that failed are now frightened as the leathery cloaks turn their heads towards you and unlatch from the statues and take to the air.
