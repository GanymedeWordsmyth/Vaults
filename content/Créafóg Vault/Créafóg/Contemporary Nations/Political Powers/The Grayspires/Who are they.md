The Grayspire’s are a noble family with holdings outside of Fairfield… They have a large contingence at court and are extremely influential in money matters as one of the richer members of the nobility. Their influence extends across the entire continent in the creation and collection of taxes that obviously funnel their way to the kingdom’s coffers but still manage to fill their pockets as well. As such they have many enemies, none more vicious than Damon’s own brother Atlas and his family.
