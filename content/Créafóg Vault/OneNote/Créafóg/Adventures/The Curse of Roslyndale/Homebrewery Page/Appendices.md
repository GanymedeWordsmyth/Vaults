# The Curse of Roslyndale Appendices
 
# Appendix A: Aging Effects
 
Anytime a character is subject to an aging effect, roll the dice listed, then consult the following table to determine by how much the character ages. Have the players update you of their new age everytime they are aged magically and consult the aging effects table to see if anything happens as a result of the aging.
 
Additionally, when a creature is subjected to an effect that magically ages that creature, and for every amount of time equal to 10% of a race's venerable age that passes when a creature is above their race's middle age, roll twice on the Aging Effects table, once on the Mental Aging Effects column and once on the Physical Aging Effects column. If a character exceeds the maximum lifespan for their race, they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15 + 1 per year in excess of their lifespan). On a failed save, the creature dies of natural causes in 3d100 days. A character tending to the needs of the aging creature with proficiency in the Medicine skill can use their skill in place of the aging creature's Constitution save. Repeat this check every birthday the creature has after their lifespan maximum.

# Appendix B: The Grove
 
Most adventurers who survive their campaigns tend to, at some point, choose a location to settle down with their spoils and live comfortably for the rest of their days. Some settle alone, some as a team. This is exactly how The Grove came to found the small village of Roslyndale.
 
The alignments given were the alignments of each member when they died. On the fourth day after arrival, when everyone descends to their fully undead status, these members' alignments will change to chaotic evil.

> - **Languages** Understands all spoken language and is understood by all creatures who speak at least one language. Can read and write common and one other language.  
> - **Challenge**  
>___  
>  
> **Alert.** Creatures don't gain advantage against Millie as a result of being unseen by her.  
>  
> **Athlete.** Millie has undergone extensive physical training and thus benefits from the following: Standing from prone only costs Millie 5 feet of movemnet. Climbing doesn't cost Millie extra movement. Millie can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot rather than 10 feet.  
>  
> ***Diamond Soul.*** Whenever Millie fails a saving throw, she can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.  
>  
> **Evasion.** Whenever Millie is subjected to an area effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving thow or take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half if she fails.  
>  
> **Ki.** Millie's training as a monk allows her to harness the mystic energy of ki. She has a total of 14 ki points and the DC required to resist a ki feature's effects is 16.  
>  
> **Focused Aim.** If Millie misses with an attack roll, she can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase that attack roll by 2 for each ki point spent in this way.  
>  
> **Stunning Strike.** Whenever Millie hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, she can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of Millie's next turn.  
>  
> **Ki-empowered strikes.** Millie's unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.  
>  
> **Sentinel.** Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from Millie even if they take the Disengage action before leaving her reach. When Millie hits a creature with an opportunity attack, that creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn. Additionally, when a creature within 5 feet of Millie makes an attack against a target other than her (unless that target also benefits from the sentinel feat), she can use her reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.  
>  
> **Tranquility.** At the end of a long rest, Millie wakes with an aura of peace. Any creature that target Millie with an attack or harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw (DC16). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This feature does not protect Millie from area of effect spells. This effect ends if Millie makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, deals damage to another creature.

> ### Actions  
>  
> ***Chuck.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 30/120ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6+6) bludgeoning damage. If the wall used its siege monster bonus action this turn to pick something up, it can chuck it towards a creature. The object shatters on impact causing shards to fly in all directions. Any creature within 5 feet of where the object landed must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a fail or half as much on a successful one.  
>  
> ***Pound.*** The wall pounds the ground with immeasureable force, causing a cacophonous boom to sweep out from it. Each creature within a 15-foot circle touching the ground must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the wall. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.  
>  
> Additionally, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushing 10 feet away from the wall.  
>  
> ***Unstoppable force.*** The wall can use its full movement to run in a straight line, gaining momentum as it does. The wall runs 40 feet, which can't be stopped by any means, including the environment, such as carts or walls. If the wall passes through another creature's space during this run, the creature must make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw, being hurled up to 30 feet away from the wall on a failed save, or moving 5 feet safely out of the way on a successful one.  
>  
> If a creature is hurled out of the way, it takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage upon landing. If a creature hurled by the wall gets thrown into something that stops it, it instead take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet it didn't travel.

>  
> **Brawler.** Whenever the Penitent Warrior makes an attack roll against a creature, it can attempt to grapple that creature as part of the attack. While a creature is grappled by the warrior, it can't make attacks against any creature other than the one it is holding.  
>  
> **Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.  
>  
> **False Appearance.** While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.  
>

>  
> ***Gambler's Greatsword +2.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.  
>  
> ### Bonus Actions  
>  
>  
> ***Engulf.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the warrior is grappling. *Hit:* the target takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage, the target is engulfed, and the grapple ends. The engulfed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the warrior, and it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage at the start of each of the penitent warrior's turns. The warrior can only have one target engulfed at a time.  
>  
> ***Release.*** The warrior releases a creature it has engulfed, causing the creature to take another 14 (4d6) poison damage. The released creature is no longer blinded or restrained. The Penitent Warrior is now free to engulf another creature.
