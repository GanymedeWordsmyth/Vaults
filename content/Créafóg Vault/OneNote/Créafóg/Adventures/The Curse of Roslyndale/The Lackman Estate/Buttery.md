The suit of armor _is_ the boss, after which the players can then take the armor. Special attacks include and engulfing attack where the armor engulfs whoever it is grappling, which counts as donning the armor and releasing creatures, which would count as doffing the armor. The character would take poison damage both ways.
 
The Penitent Warrior:  
~~Start with stats for the Animated Armor on MM19~~  
~~Str = 16~~  
~~Con = 15~~  
~~HP = 52 (8d8+16)~~  
~~Replace the slam attack with two weapon attacks, one for the gambler's blade and one for the silver sword, though in this fight, have the Warrior favor the gambler's blade +2~~  
~~For the multiattack, the Warrior makes 2 strikes against a creature. If both hit, the creature is automatically grappled. Otherwise, the Warrior can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet of it.~~  
~~Add another action: Engulf. The warrior's armor opens and engulfs a creature being grappled by the warrior. At this point the armor is free to grapple another creature. The warrior can only have one creature engulfed at a time. A creature that starts its turn engulfed takes xdy+z poison damage at the start of its turn. A creature that escapes the engulf takes the same dice of damage when it escapes.~~  
Add another action: Release. The warrior releases a creature it has engulfed, causing the same xdy+z poison damage to the creature. The released creature is no longer grappled or restrained.
