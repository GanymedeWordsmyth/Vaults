Basically, the way this works is there are different mission types to choose from, each with listed rewards. Up to four players can be grouped up at any one time. Then each group chooses a mission from those available. The party will also have a chronicler. Any one of the player's characters can fill this role, which will have incentives. If none of the players wish to be the chronicler, one will be appointed to them, in the form of the DM. An appointed chronicler observes and defends only themselves and does not otherwise interact with the party.

A DM will then pick up and run that mission for the night. Loot will be found throughout the mission. 

The chronicler, if none was appointed, then debriefs the mission in the chronicles channel of the discord.

Each group disbands after each mission is completed.

When creating a new character for the Parcel, it is important that the character leaves their past behind, regardless of what it was. Why did they join the Parcel? What do they want from the Parcel? What are their personal goals?
