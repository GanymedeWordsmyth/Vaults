Treasure:  
Heaven's Chronical  
This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings unfolds into an armillary sphere. As a bonus action, you can unfold it into the sphere or back into a disc. While in disc form, it can be used as an astrolabe. By speaking the command word while in disc mode, the astrolabe calibrates itself based on which world the Heaven's Chronical is on and it's latitudinal position on that world. Speaking the command word while it is in sphere mode, the armillary sphere calibrates itself based on which world the Heaven's Chronical is on.
