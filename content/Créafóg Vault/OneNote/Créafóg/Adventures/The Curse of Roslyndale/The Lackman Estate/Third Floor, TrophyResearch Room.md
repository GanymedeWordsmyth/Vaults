Door riddle:  
To my beloved children  
Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn  
The key to my laboratory  
Is hidden within an old story  
Where you learnt to count  
With the dryad who'd frount  
And lead all her friends to glory
   

1 Dryad alone in her grove  
2 Iron statues standing guard  
3 Vegepymies race to the grove to plea for help  
"4 Ettercap are destroying our village" they cry  
"5 Needle blights they had awakened"  
6 Stone warriors she sends frowning  
7 Rats skitter out of the way  
8 Elk ram into their foes as  
9 Sanguineous enemies run for their lives  
10 Thank yous to the dryad for saving the day

When the party gets to the top floor, the door is locked. They need to find the key to enter. The space is protected from planar and ethereal travel so you can't just teleport into the room with a spell like Dimension Door.
 
This is a private library and trophy room where the Lackmans keep their prized possessions. The walls of the tower above Kethra's room is lined with books all the way up and three scaffold layers to reach each layer
 
A sentient grimoire codex sits on a pedestal in this room
 
A ten page children's book commissioned by Mr. Lackman sits in Kethra's, Branlyn's, and Silifrey's room. In this book lies the key to unlocking the door to the top room. He did this so that his children could eventually enter the room. The key phrase is Diven's Rest D-I-V-E-N-S-R-E-S-T, the subject of Heward's life's work. On each page is a clue to each letter of the passphrase. Speak the passphrase in front of the door to unseal it.  
Throughout the Lackman Estate, have the players experience the children's memories of when Heward tells them about how important the book is.  
A riddle is placed on the door pointing his children to read the book he commissioned for entry.
