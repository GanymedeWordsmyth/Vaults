Borexaanvir as an Ancient Blue Dragon:
Imagine Borexaanvir towering with imposing grandeur, his scales shimmering in varying shades of deep blue and azure, reflecting the sky above. Lightning crackles softly between his fangs, a testament to his power over the storm. His eyes, ancient and wise, hold a piercing gaze that seems to see through time itself. His wings, vast as clouds, are ready to blot out the sun as he takes to the sky. His presence commands fear, respect, and awe, with the air around him charged with the static of impending thunder.

[[Caius Varr]], the Humanoid Guise:
[[Caius Varr]] appears as a distinguished figure, his posture radiating confidence and a subtle, underlying strength. He has striking blue eyes that mirror his dragonic essence, carrying an intensity that can both unsettle and draw one in. His hair is dark, with hints of blue highlights that catch the light. He dresses in fine garments that blend noble elegance with practicality, suitable for someone of his intellect and station. A pendant, bearing the semblance of a dragon coiled around a lightning bolt, hangs from his neck - the only hint of his true form.
