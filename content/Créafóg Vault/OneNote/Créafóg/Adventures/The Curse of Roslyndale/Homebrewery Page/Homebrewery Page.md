# The Curse of Roslyndale
 
**Needs a rewrite: incorrect info**
 
Mistress Westra Lackman, a woman already in mourning from losing her husband, lost all three of her children to a plague that ransacked this otherwise sleepy town of Roslyndale. Desperate to have her children returned to her, she hired the aid of Mr Henry Cotton, the local wizard new to the town. Sadly, Mr. Cotton was not high enough level to cast the necessary resurrection spells. Unluckily for Mr Cotton, Mistress Lackman also knew about his past from which he was running and was using it as blackmail, so he had no alternative than to find someway around his restriction.
 
As her patience grew thin, Mr Cotton was unable to test the ritual after completing a working prototype before the Mistress found out and forced him to execute it prematurely, his despondent pleas falling on deaf ears. The ritual, having been so close to the end, yet still too far out of reach, was a complete disaster that billowed out a shock wave to the rest of town, destroying all in its path in a very unique way.
 
The town and its residents now sit in a time rift, forced to relive the final day of its demise ending each day with that fateful shock wave that rolled through town in the dead of night.
 
## Hooks
 
The players can become aware of Roslyndale through rumors or idle conversation with shopkeepers and innkeepers. "Something strange is going on in a nearby plague ridden town."
 
## Background
 
## How to use this module
 
To keep tension and mystery, this module rubberbands the party from where they were at night to the next morning when they get close to figuring something out. The air you should go for is cosmic horror.
 
The white boxes are box text to read to your players directly. Feel free to edit these as you see fit. Some of the text in these boxes will be bolded. This is to denote that you, as the DM, are waiting for the characters to do something before reading the rest of the box text. Anything in a box text that is italicized is a note to you, the DM, that instructs you to do something.
 
With each box text, I would recommend calling out that you, the DM, are about to read...well...box text. I usually same something like, "alright, this next part is a cutscene," or literally just, "box text" then reading the text. By calling it out, you set the stage for the players to keep their questions until the end so you can read the text smoothly.

# Roslyndale Dreams
 
You can opt to walk a PC through the following dream either in private or with every one else around to give them a hint as to what is happening in the town. The figure in the beginning is written to be Kelemvor as an example, but feel free to change it to be who or whatever you feel is most appropriate or omit the figure entirely. Also, the dreams are written to fit in my world. It describes the sun and moons and the Sovereign Concordat, which is basically a country wide police force. Feel free to change this around however you need to fit your setting.
 
Read everything verbatim except for what is in bold. Anything in bold is a note for you as the DM. When you see an ellipsis (…) it will be followed by a number. Skip the remainder of the text until you get to the corresponding ellipses that begins with the matching number. Italics denote speech.
 
## Pre-Arrival Dream
 
You awaken in a dark liminal space. You can barely make out any details in the distance. A hooded figure in black robes holding scales palm down with a skeletal hand steps into view and calmly approaches you. An ornate breastplate peaks through the folds and a long pewter greatsword hangs loosely across the figures back. He extends another skeletal hand out of the left side of his robes as if to beckon for yours. Do you take it?
 
You take the figures hand and the two of you face forward and the figure raises the scales as the darkness dissolves away. You look to your right and the figure is gone and the hand you were holding gone as well.
 
Looking forward again, you stand at the entrance to a ruined town. As you look around you notice it is completely barren and in disarray. It is cold, and dark with a faint bit of moon light shining from the two moons, Aide and Minuris. A low fog hangs over the desolate town, heavy, yet transparent. There is a faint noise in the distance, rhythmic and chaotic. You are too far away to be able to identify it.
 
You watch a board drop off from one of the windows of a boarded up house. Looking back up, you find yourself standing in the middle of a graveyard where you see a walking circle around dead cherry tree. Leading away from the tree are three paths in three different directions. Looking down each path, you can see a statue down the first, a clearing down the second, and a Mausoleum down the third. The rhythmic sound you heard at the entrance of the town resonates off the tombstones, louder than before but still too far to identify. Which path do you take? **Skip to read only the path the player chooses. Do not read them another path other than what they choose.**
 
<div style='margin-top:178px'></div>
 
### Statue path
 
You arrive at the marble statue depicting a woman clutching three children tightly, her face contorted in anguish. Tears of blood stream down the statue's face. You hear from the woman rhythmic wails and sobs. It's the same sound you've been hearing since you arrived. There is a plaque at the base of the statue that's hard to read. You move closer to the statue to inspect it further and a single blue flame emerges by one of the children. Then another. And a third. You are taken aback as the three flames dance around the statue. You raise your arm towards them and the flames stop dancing and shift aggressively towards you before charging in your direction their light blinding you for a moment. When your eyes finally refocus, …1
 
### Clearing path
 
You arrive standing in the middle of a clearing in the graveyard. There are no trees. There are no tombstones. As you focus and look around you see a circle of some kind drawn on the ground glowing a faint amber glow. Gossamers of smoke rise from four points around the circle as you hear shouting, "*This is a terrible idea Mistress. Bringing people back is tremendously dangerous!*" calls an elderly man.
 
"*I care not for the consequences Mr Cotton. I paid you your price and you will obey. Or do I need to send word to the Sovereign Concordat?*" snaps the woman in a threatening manner.
 
"*No Mistress, I will complete the ritual.*" He acquiesces.
 
You hear chanting as the smoke becomes thicker and heavier. A strong wind starts to whip, kicking up dirt and leaves, causing you to instinctually put your arms up defensively, averting your eyes. When you put your arms down and open your eyes, …1
 
### Mausoleum path
 
You arrive at the mausoleum and can see a name above the door, but it is out of focus and hard to read. You step through into the mausoleum and find yourself in a small marble room. In the center of the room is a black stone statue of a robed figure wearing a long beaked mask. In the crook of the figure's arm rests a winged staff with two snakes coiling around the middle. The figure's thumbs, first fingers, and pinkies touch at the tips and the middle and ring fingers are curled in so they touch at the first knuckle.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
The three walls recess to form three shelves. On the left shelf rests an urn depicting Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface and a small wooden doll carved out of walnut. The shelf on the back wall hosts an urn depicting Veraudinus, the sun, at his zenith shining gloriously down over the world and a child sized wooden sword and bow both carved out of maple. In the shelf on the right sits an urn depicting Minuris shining resplendently in the midnight sky. Next to this urn sits a marionette carved from ash wood. **DC12 nature check reveals that these woods represents different aspects of the spiritual world.** You hear a woman crying behind you through the door. The rhythm is the same as the rhythm you heard when you first entered the town and again when you arrived in the graveyard. You walk through the door and find …1
 
1… you are in a hallway with three doors on each side, each framing a moderately sized bust mirror in between them. There is a staircase behind you leading to the front door. The door at the end of the hall slowly creaks open, the sound of a crying woman resounding from within. What do you do?
 
**The other doors are locked. If the player tries to leave the hallway down the staircase (the only other place they can go), read the following:** You take a step down the staircase to your right and you hear a soft masculine voice in your ear, "*Now, now Mistress. We need to get you to bed.*"  
"*But that's where they…*" You can't finish your sentence before a small whimper leaves your lips.**
 
You glance into one of the mirrors as you walk towards the door and see the reflection of a man in the mirror put an arm around your shoulder as deafening wails of grief explode out from behind your lips. You look back towards the door and your hands come up and meet your face as you continue to sob into them. You continue forward, ever walking. Towards the door. It seems like an eternity. Your grief is endless. Immeasurable. Finally you reach the door and as soon as you touch it, all is quiet. The man is gone, your clothes are your own. You are your own. You take a second to ground yourself before entering the room. You push silently into the room and see a woman crying in a corner arms outstretched onto an elegant four post bed. Over the bed hovers three distinct blue flames. She also glows a faint bluish hue. What do you do?
 
**Turn back:** you turn slowly and step carefully towards the door and a board creaks under your weight and the door snaps shut in an instant. You look back in terror she is staring furiously, …2
 
**Continue forward:** you step forward and as a board creaks under your weight, her head shoots furiously in your direction, …2
 
2… staring into your soul for but a moment before she cries a blood curdling wail! She raises and sweeps her hand and even though she's across the room, you feel a force thrust you into the nearby closet and the door slams shut. The darkness slowly suffocating, the walls shrinking ever towards you until finally a hand reaches through the door, through your flesh and into your chest and you feel her grasp you heart in her hand. Fingers and nails long and sharp you feel them dig slowly into your heart as she shrieks, "You are mine!" You awaken gasping for breath, your head pounding as though you've been holding your breath for far too long you grasp at your heart scrambling to find its beat and you feel nothing. You rip your shirt open and look down. There upon your chest, right where your heart is, lies a bruise in the shape of a hand print. As you place your hand upon the bruise a horrible pain shoots through your entire body and you convulse backwards, the back of your head plows into the pillow and all goes black.
 
Th-dump
 
Th-dump
 
Th-dump
 
As you lie in bed, eyes closed, you feel its beat. Slow, rhythmic. You are left with two words stuck in your head that you know to be from Kelemvor: *Bring Peace*

# Arrival  
The party arrives just before sundown. Enough time to enter the town and visit a couple shops and get their bearings before they have to head over to the only Inn in town, The Wandering Flower, run by Millie and Henry Kinsley. Named thusly after what Henry used to call his wife when she was an adventurer. The upper floor of the tavern are rooms for rent at the standard rate of 5sp for the modest rooms.
 
Have the characters notice that the quaint little town is a little run down and could use some love and attention. As the party roams the town, make sure to keep track of what the party buys and how much they spend at each shop.
 
As you roleplay the townsfolk, keep in mind that the goal is to make the players feel like something is off about this place. I played the townfolk as sickly sweet and overly helpful and that seemed to do very well. Another thing you can do is when a player character asks a shopkeeper a question, answer that question as though it is related to the products in the shop. The same can be done with other non-shopkeeper townsfolk too. As an example, one of my characters asked about some undead that could possibly be around the town, and the herbalist responded with, "Oh yes, I think we have some of that in the back." Then brought out some kind of dried and crushed herb blend.
 
At some point, have the characters notice a figure wearing all black from head to toe enter a shop. I did this as they approached the town when they were still too far to make out any details, but feel free to do this anytime after their arrival but before sundown. When the party enters the shop to investigate, read them the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You walk into the shop and immediately, you are bombarded with the sweet smell of cakes, warm pastries, and icing. At the counter finishing her business with the shopkeeper is a woman wearing a finely crafted black, floor length dress with elbow long gloves. Her elegant lace veil so thin it almost looks like it was made from spider's silk. She nods to you all as she exits, "*it's nice to see some new faces around here.*" Her voice skips as one holding back tears, though her veil hides whether this is true. "*Fairweather Mr. Marlborough,*" she says to the man behind the counter with a light curtsey before continuing about her day.   "*Fairweather Mistress Lackman,*" he responds before turning to you all. "*Poor lady, lost all three of her dearest not long to the plague. Well anyways,*" His demeanor becomes more chipper and customer friendly, "*my apologies for such a dreary introduction to our little town. My name is Mr. Marlborough and the here is my bakery. How may I be of assistance today?*"  
</div>
 
> ##### **Plot point:**  
>  
> It's marginally important that they rent a room at the Wandering Flower on their first night, for reasons that become apparent later. Though, if the party insists that they stay elsewhere for the evening, feel free to let them. You'll just have to do some DM magic behind the scenes a bit and change some of the language going forward. The party will wake up each morning in the spot they chose to bed down on the first night.
 
### Rumormill
 
As with most small towns, gosip spreads throughout like a wildfire in a forest during dry season. The following can be used to immerse the players further and give them an insight into what was happening in the days leading up to the end of Roslyndale. Feel free to add your own happenings to this list in laying the seeds for future adventures. These rumors can be used anywhere in the town, such as overheard in the market square, the commons, or the tavern. As with most rumors, the conjectures are largely untrue, and parts of the fact may also be partially incorrect, misheard, or misrepresented.
 
- Mistress Lackman has been spending quite an amount of time with Mr Henry Cotton. Most conclude that this means they are having an affair. They curse her name a little, but mostly his, since he is married to Eleanor. Those who curse her name for this assume she is forcing him into the affair, which isn't entirely wrong, which you'll read later.  
- Strange lights and noises are coming from the Lackman Estate most nights, especially on the 3rd floor. Most conclude that Mr Lackman, quite an accomplished wizard, had some untoward magical experiments that has now started going awry in his absence.  
- Mr Lackman is known for traveling to ruins for study. Some conclude that he was having an affair with other people.  
- Mr Heward Lackman has been gone for a very long time. Most conclude that he either ran as far away from Mistress Lackman as could, or died on an excursion to some magical ruins.

# The First Night
 
Every evening at 1:30am the spell failure occures, causing an shockwave to roll through the town. This wakes every *living* creature in town, including the PCs. Whenever the party rests within the bounds of Roslyndale, have everyone roll a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw at this time. Since nothing significant happened between their arrival and now, and they've likely had some downtime during travel to Roslyndale, they shouldn't need a full long rest.
 
> ##### Plot point:  
>  
> Remind everyone before going to sleep that they only reset their character sheets and choose new spells and such at the *end* of a long rest.
 
For anyone that failed their Wisdom Saving Throw, read them the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
Something jostles you awake this night, though you aren't sure what. A loud sound? A rumbling in the earth? It's difficult to tell. You remind yourself that it was probably just the town's wildlife like in the many towns you've been in before. You lie with your eyes still closed trying to return to sleep when you hear the sound of a child's laughter as they play just outside your window.  
</div>
 
If any of the party members want to fall back to sleep, have each of them roll another DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw. Whoever decided to go back to sleep skips to the next day unless the ones who didn't jostle them awake. Those that fail have their slumber wracked with nightmares. Have anyone who failed roll a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. The nightmares of those who fail this save turn to night terrors and they wake up with a level of exhaustion and don't benefit from a long rest.
 
If any of them get up to investigate, read the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you open your eyes, you notice the modestly cared for room you fell asleep in is completely desolate. The walls are gray and mostly peeled off. The floors are long since rotted and splintered. There is a large gaping whole to the first floor in the corner by the door. What do you do?  
</div>
 
```  
```
 
If the party makes their way towards the tavern, read the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You walk down the stairs and into the tavern. Looking around, you see the money you gave to the Kinsleys to pay for the room is still right where you left it. Neither Millie nor Henry are in sight, although from experience, you know that after a certain time, innkeepers retire to their quarters not to far from the front desk. You see a small bell sitting on the counter that you hadn't noticed before. Late comers often ring the bell to summon the sleeping innkeepers.  
</div>
 
If anyone tries to pick up and ring the bell, the clapper falls to the floor, old and rusted. The bell itself has a gaping hole on the side that was facing away from the party. A door opens and dull footsteps are heard approaching from down the hallway. If the party waits or investigates, they'll find that there is no one there.
 
If the party ate here during the day, anyone looking around the room will notice a small pile of coin sitting on the table where they were eating at earlier. It's in the exact amount and denomination that the party spent on food and drink.
 
> ##### Note  
>  
> Even though this section is called The First Night, this plays out every evening the party stays in Roslyndale.  
>  
> Also, unless the party starts at sundown, each night has about enough time to explore 2 houses or areas.  
>  
> If they do start at sundown, they have about enough time to explore 4 or 5 houses or areas.
 
Regardless of whether or not the party experiences this, when they do decide to leave, have everyone roll a perception check. The highest check notices first that a second story window of the house about a 5 minute walk away glows with a faint bluish hue.
 
If the party continues to this house, skip ahead to the Two-Story House section

# Decaying Townsfolk
 
As the days progress, the townsfolk slowly start to resemble their actual dead nature and they become increasingly irate at the presence of the party. The following is a guide to how the town and its residence look and act towards the party depending on how many days have passed. This section only goes into effect after the the party finishes their first night. Ergo, the section titled "The First Day" is the day after the party arrived.
 
No matter what stage decay the townsfolk are in, as soon as the sun sets, during the short period of twilight, everyone snaps back to looking like they did on day one, even if they were in the middle of a fight, and will no longer be hostile towards the party. As the twilight fades, their bodies fade with it, until they are completely gone. The bodies of the children during this time fade to the familiar blue floating flames that are the Will-o'-Wisps.
 
### The First Day
 
Anyone with a passive Perception of 16 (DC14 if calling rolls) and above will notice the residents are gaunt and haggard with pale, ashen skin.
 
The residents are still pleasant, but their sickly sweet demeanor is replaced with mild irritability, as one is when they are forced to go to work with a stomach ache or hangover.
 
The first day is mostly for the characters to be able to use what little information they learned on their first night in Roslyndale so nothing exciting (or inciting) really happens on this day. It's just a normal village, just everyone's a bit more grumpy.
 
### The Second Day
 
The residents look far more gaunt today, as anyone with a passive Perception of 10 and above will be able to tell. Those with a passive Perception of 14 and above will notice random bruises have developed over the townsfolks' bodies, looking further, their eyes are pale and glazed and the ends of their fingers and nose are blue-ish and discolored.
 
They now greet the players with mild hostility, saying things like, "why are you here" and "when will you be leaving."
 
If you decided to use the [Research Team](#p11), after finishing up with the Kinsley's, a loud scream echos from near the town square where there will be 3 decidedly dead bodies in the center. The townsfolk not only don't notice the bodies, when asked about them, they are genuinely confused about their existence. From the townsfolk's perspective, these bodies do not exist, no matter how thoroughly they are shown.
 
```  
```
 
> ##### Plot Point  
>  
> It's important to keep track of how many days the party spends in the town of Roslyndale. Don't worry too much about what day of the week it is, though, just on what day they are waking.
 
### The Third Day
 
Characters with a passive Perception of 10 and above will notice that the peoples' mouths have tightened to the point where their teeth are showing more, everyone's eyes are fully sunken, their noses are shrivel to the point where you can almost see their nasal cavity. Anyone with a passive Perception of 14 and above notices the resident's skin is so paper thin that their bones and long since dried blood vessels show through. Their nails and teeth appear to have grown unnaturally long as the skin around them has receded completely.
 
The party is now met with open hostility, though the tonsfolk will not yet fight them, with accusations such as, "How dare you diturb our slumber" and "you being here is the Mistress's fault" and "that damned Henry Cotton put you up to this, didn't he?" and "everything was fine until the Cottons arrived."
 
If you decided to include the [Research Team](#p11), the party finds Mole scavenging in an empty house. The [Research Team](#p11) section will give you more information.
 
### The Fourth Day and Beyond
 
Everyone in the town has gone full rotting romero zombie, no longer with any intelligence, and will attack any living creature on sight that has stayed in the town for this many days or longer. If the party kills anyone, they rise again the next morning as though nothing happened. You can find the romero zombie stat block in the appendices.
 
Some things to note: romero zombies are immune to all physical damage not dealt from magical weapons. Romeros are very slow and gather in hordes. As the DM, use the hordes to push the party in the direction of the parts of the storyline that the party members haven't yet been able to crack.
 
### The Fifth Day and Beyond, optional
 
If you want to add a little more urgency and a survival aspect to the storyline, add one or more of the special romeroes from the appendix for every day past the fouth day.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
# Mornings
 
As the sun rises, the characters wake up wherever they decided to bed down regardless of where they were when the sun rises having successfully finished a long rest. Any party members that died also wake rested. If the players stayed at the Wandering Flower, one of the following dialogues plays out every morning until day 5 and beyond when everyone goes full romero, at which point the Kinsleys attack the party when they arrive at the scene. The scene plays out as any of the characters descend the staircase, approaching the tavern.
 
With the exception of magic items, which are not subject to the town reset, any treasure that was attained the previous night are no longer in the party's inventory. If a magic item was found in a house or place of business, add the "stolen" magic items to the rumormill section as the previous owners are now looking for them.
 
If the party took the money on the table used to pay for their meals and rooms the previous evening, and has at least one rogue, or otherwise shady PC in the party, read the following box text:  
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Took the money, has a Rogue   As you descend the stairs, you hear the Kinsley's voices quietly arguing, "maybe it was, Henry, maybe it wasn't. Don't you remember Aranor, the elf thief, in my party?" Millie's voice tries to calm Henry.   "Oh I remember!" Henry retorts, "I rather didn't like him either."   "But he was good at what he did. They're still starting off, we don't need the money, we have plenty more. Let them have this as practice."   You enter the tavern and Millie turns towards you all, "Good morning! How was your night?"  
</div>
 
If the party took the money from the previous evening, but has no rogues, or doesn't have any shady PCs in the party, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Took the money, has no Rogue
 
"No, it wasn't the adventurers. They don't even have a thief in their party," Millie's voice can be heard when walking down the stairs, approaching the tavern.   "But it's the exact amount those ratcatchers-" Henry retorts   Millie cuts him off, "hush now, you know I don't like that word. Don't forget that I was also an adventurer once."   "That doesn't mean-" She cuts him off again as you arrive in the tavern, "Ah looks like we company! Good morning! How was your night?"  
</div>
 
> ##### Roleplaying the Kinsleys  
>  
> Millie used to be an adventurer and has since retired with her gains in this town with Henry. She has 8 levels in Open Fist Monk. Millie Kinsley is a laid-back, humble soul who doesn't like to be flashy with her wealth and abilities.  
>  
> Henry is far more regular than Millie, who had always been more intrepid than he. The two were engaged to marry far before Millie became an adventurer. In fact, Millie became an adventurer originally to save Henry who was nabbed and held hostage, forced to work tirelessly in the salt mines. After Millie was finally able to rescue Henry, she had some unfinished business with the rest of her party. Henry was very understanding and married her, taking her last name, before she left. He used to call her his Wandering Flower when they were able to spend time together.  
>  
> After Millie's business was finished with her group, she and Henry found a small village to settle down in and enjoy the rest of their life in relative peace. All was well until the spell failure.  
>  
> Draft a Level 8 Open Fist Monk sheet for when everyone goes full romero, because that is what the party will fight if they enter the tavern on day 5 or beyond. Henry becomes a regular zombie.
 
If the party left the money on right where it was, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Left the money alone   "Look, I know they haven't done nothing yet, but look at all the mischief you got up to as in your ratcatching days." You hear Henry speak as you descend the stairs, his voice sounds concerned.   "Henry, please stop using that word. I truly don't like it. If they cause too much mischief, I'll talk to them." Millie retorts.   "My Wandering Flower, it may be too late when that happens."   "Hush now, I hear someone coming down the stairs." She turns towards you as you enter the tavern, "Good morning! How was your night?"

# Mistress Lackman's Final Routine
 
As has been previously talked about, the town is cursed to relive its very last day and completely resets every morning. Mistress Lackman visits the market square first then follows the same route every day the characters wake outlined below, eventually finding herself and Mr. Cotton in the third floor laboratory where the spell fails, blasting out the same bluish shock wave and transforms the town into what is seen every night, at about 1:15am. Until then, the night is completely normal.   This also means that all monsters (with the exception of any tempus cari and any monsters killed by the tempus cari), residual hauntings, and treasure (except any magic items) are also reset. I run by milestone leveling, so I don't have to worry about XP farming, but feel free to lessen the difficulty of the monsters they encounter to prevent this.
 
Before the death of her children, Mistress Lackman enjoyed making an almost daily public appearance in the goings on in the town to boost moral and make people feel welcome and cared for. This closed the gap between the working class and what little nobility, if you can call it that, was present in this Roslyndale.
 
Even after the death of her children, she still made an effort to show herself in town, though it was far less frequent. Only a handful of days every week. The final day was one of these days. The whole circuit takes the full day from sunrise to sunset and between each destination, she makes frequent stops into many of the shops on the way to ask how business is going.
 
## The Market Square
 
Mistress Lackman always begins her routine at the market square to buy a basket of pastries and other gifts for the businesses around the village, and her final day was no exception. Arriving bright and early, just after sunrise, she is garbed in her black mourning dress described in the group's first encounter with her. On this day in particular, she also purchases some supplies for the mills.
 
## Mr Marlborough's Bakery
 
Before starting on her weekly checks, the Mistress stops into Mr. Marlborough's Bakery in the Market Square. Pastries and other baked goods are a delightful way to raise moral. This also doubles as a job-well-done for the millers that make the flour for the bakers.
 
## The Milling District
 
Her next destination is the village milling area, Roslyndale's main export comes from here. She always visits the mills at least once a week to check on production and take note of any other operational necessities the mills may need.
 
```

## Back to the Bakery
 
Having delivered all her sweets to the millers, the Mistress heads back to the bakery to pick up more fresh sweets for the prefecture and it's constables.
 
This occurs at whatever time of day you as the DM adjudicated the players first reached the village on their [Arrival](#p6) day.
 
If Mistress Lackman gets here before the characters, reread the box text again when they enter the shop, allowing for interruptions this time if they wish. Otherwise, modify the box text ad hoc to suit the situation.
 
## The Prefecture
 
Being a village, Roslyndale doesn't benefit much from a "guard" per se. Their watchmen are merely the men and women of the village that volunteer to be watchers. Everyone is paid a healthy wage for their service to Roslyndale.
 
The prefecture is the watcher station, where the village watch comes to get their routes, bring criminals for judgement, and store weapons. Weapons in this instance is a loose term for what the watchers wield in defense.
 
The current head of the watchers is Mrs. Ilene Pratcher, an intelligent elf-woman with the penchant for keeping things under control.
 
Mistress Lackman always makes an appearance here whenever she starts on any route to check on how the day is going and whether or not anything needs fetching or doing. Before departing, she leaves her remaining pastries, all but two, for the staff and the return of the watchers on duty.
 
## The Cotton Residence
 
After finishing up in the prefecture, Mistress Lackman heads over to the Cotton residence to talk to Henry about the final preparations before they convene for the ritual at the third floor of her estate.
 
An argument can be heard from inside the house near the north east corner. If the players press themselves up against a wall of this room, they get advantage on their perception check to hear the conversation. This is the same argument as is in the dream.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
"This is a terrible idea Mistress. Bringing people back is tremendously dangerous!" Calls an elderly man.
 
"I care not for the consequences Mr Cotton. I paid you your price and you will obey. Or do I need to send word to the Sovereign Concordat?" snaps the Mistress in a threatening manner.
 
"No Mistress, I will complete the ritual." He acquiesces.

# Research Team, optional
 
Over the years, citizens traveling to this town have disappeared. Ever since then, those in charge, having too few resources to fully investigate this area, have deemed Roslyndale unfit for travelers. Not many have heard of Roslyndale, however, due to the government covering up its existence, fearing that if word got around about a "haunted town," news would spread and make the town more attractive.
 
Everyonce in a while a permit is attained from those in charge by small parties wishing to visit the town for one reason or another. These parties give a convincing enough argument to warrent such permission. The only stipulation is the you do not speak of what is in the town to anyone not listed in the contract.
 
This is exactly what happened for a small research team of four individuals that recent entered the town only a few days before the player's arrival. The three bodies found in the commons are three out of four of the research team that were killed by the romero zombies. The only survivor, a halfling called Mole, is now terrified and in hiding, desperately trying to stay alive and finish what the team set out to do.
 
### Alton Lyle Lindal Merric Gerric Milo Thorngage
 
Or known more simply as Mole, for his deep love of archeology and study of the world's civilizations long since dead and forgotten.
 
#### Meeting Mole
 
Sometime on day three, the party may find an empty house. Read the following, the bolded bits are story beats to wait for:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You see a small, dark shape move in the window of one of the houses. What do you do?   **Upon entering the house, [read:**](http://read:**) Entering the house, you hear a clattering on a table in the next room.   **Upon moving to the next room, [read:**](http://read:**) When you enter the room, you smell warmed up dried rations and look over to see a plate of dried meats and vegetables on a dinner table. There is a fork laying haphazardly on top of the meal.  
</div>
 
Only a DC 11 wisdom (Perception) check is needed to see Mole cowering in the corner. When the party finds him, he shakely holds out a pairing knife towards the party in as much of a threatening manner as he can muster, which isn't much, pleading desperately, "please just go away, I don't want to be eaten!!"
 
<div style='margin-top:120px'></div>
 
#### Mole's Knowledge Base
 
Mole being an archeologist who studies past civilizations, feel free to add to this list anything to do with your personal campaign setting. If they are interested, this can be a chance for your players to gain access to knowledge that commoners don't have about the past.
 
- Every night there is a loud magical disturbance that explodes outwards in a shockwave that rattles the whole town.  
- The disruption is likely what caused the town to be what it is today.  
- The team was attempting to identify the origin of the disruption when they noticed everyone looked like walking corpses. They started studying the corpses in hopes that any answers would lead to their final goal.  
- Once the townsfolk reached full corpse, everyone attacked as one hive mind. I narrowly escaped with my life.  
- I've started calling them romero's corpses since Romero was the one in our party fascinated by them. He was in the process of writing a scholarly paper on the topic of walking corpses. This was another reason we were inspecting them as he doesn't get too many opportunities to study them.
 
After they've gotten information out of Mole, he'll bashfully ask the players for help giving them a proper burial, as he's too small to be able to lift them. This should push them towards the graveyard if they haven't visited it yet.
 
#### Mole as an ally
 
The main goal being accomplished in letting the party meet Mole is that he is capable of fitting together all the bits of imformation the party has been able to obtain up to this point. He cannot answer questions about how to help everyone nor how to end the curse, as he, himself, does not know. However, he can point the party in a direction for them to explore. If the party hasn't explored fully the church, he'll send them there. If the party hasn't finished the cemetery, that's where he'll say to go. If the players have explored those two areas, but don't yet know about the estate, he'll point that out to them. Additionally, if the players found Henry's coded journal and notes, he's able to translate them with 1 full day of study.

# Important Houses
 
The party is free to explore any part of the town of Roslyndale. However, as stated previously, the more time they spend here, the more dangerous the town becomes. There are a few key areas in the town that give the players the opportunity to figure out everything that is happening here.
 
Starting off this section is a random encounter chart for whenever the party wishes to go in a completely different direction, as players often do. In this case, draw a one story, one room house that is between 30 and 45 feet to a side, put in a bed, table and chairs, some windows, and a hearth. If you decide to put in a child's bed, make sure a wisp glides out of the corpse at some point in their stay, whenever you deem it most appropriate. After that, roll on the random encounters chart to see what, if anything, is in there. Examples of Residual Hauntings can be found in the appendices.
 
The remainder of this section outlines the important locations other than the Lackman House.

### Farmer's House
 
If the party follows the child from the end of the tavern scene, they end up here. Read the following upon them entering or peering through a window into the house:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
The first floor interior is in complete disarray. The floor is decayed and splintering. In the corner by the front door is a broken dining table with some chairs around it, one of which is also broken, and a high chair. Looking closer, it almost seems like someone is sitting at the table but your eyes readjust and nothing is there. A case on the left holds a few personal affects of the owners and some toys for an infant. On the back wall are two doors framing a hearth.  
</div>
 
Behind the door to the right is a small pantry with food long since rotted and withered.
 
If anyone inspects the case on the left, they hear sounds of a child cooing as a rattle is heard shaking back and forth.
 
<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>
 
If anyone inspects the hearth, read them the following:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
Warm smoke rises from the cauldron in the cold hearth as you approach. When you look in to inspect it, the floorboards above you creak under someone's weight as you hear gentle footsteps cross the top floor slowly. A soft, feminine lullaby is heard being hummed. This catches your attention and you look up to see a completely new and vibrant ceiling that is very well taken care of, light from the hearth fire dancing off the crossbeams. When you look back to the hearth, you see the bottom of a cold, dark cauldron, and the humming above ceases.  
</div>
 
When the party decides to go through the door on the left, have them all make a DC10 perception check. Those who decide not to make the check with advantage. Read the following to those that pass:
 
<div class='descriptive'>Those that pass glance back and see a bear of a man with broad shoulders the size of a barn wearing a typical farmer's outfit sitting at the table horrifically stuffing his face, his back towards the party. Food, drink, and slobber spews from his mouth as he gorges himself voraciously. What do you do?  
**Read the following for anyone that move towards the man:**   The man slowly turns his head in your direction, mouth full of rotten food and drink gushing from the bottom of throat. A large glob of saliva forms out of the corner of his gaping maw, chewing mouth wide open, and as it falls to the floor, splattering on impact, the man lunges towards you all.  
</div>
 
Have everyone who moved towards the man make a DC15 Wisdom Saving Throw or be aged 1d8 years, or half as much on a save, modified by the character's ansestry as described in the appendices.
 
Wait for the player's reactions to be finished, and when they are read to move through the door, they do so without further issue and are met with the bottom of an old staircase. As they climb the staircase, make sure to tell them how rickety and unsafe the staircase feels. This will be important later as they are leaving.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
When they reach the top of the landing, they are met with another closed door. The door is unlocked and can be opened with ease. Read the following to any that enter:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You enter the room, moonlight shining through the fog, casting deep, dark shadows throught the space. You see a chamber pot and wash basin along the back wall you're standing by. In the far back corner sits a turning wheel with broken down cotton attached. A side table sits next to a bed in front of you. The sheets and blankets are old and decayed. In the bed rests two leathery corpses, the larger frame on its back and the smaller of the two on its side away from the other. The smaller one's feet are cluching around the closer foot of the larger body.   To the right of the bed is a hooded bassinette in the same condition as the bed. A skirt hangs around the trim obscuring the inside. The cooing of an infant resonates from within the bassinette. What do you do?  
</div>
 
If anyone moves towards the bassinette or trying to attack it at range, Have everyone in the room roll a DC 14 perception check and after they announce their results, roll initiative. Anyone who failed is surprised on the first round. Those who pass, notice that the shadows on the bodies are no longer as dark as they were.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
After defeating the shadows, everyone in the room notices a pulsating blue glow resonating from inside the bassinette.
 
**Anyone that inspects the bassinette** notices a blue flame emerges from what appears to be a leathery doll. The flame bobs gently out of the window and into the house across the way.   **Anyone that looks out the window** sees a small child beckoning to them to follow.  
</div>
 
In truth the blue flame, or Will-o'-Wisp, is traveling towards the Lackman Estate and Mistress Lackman, but being incorporeal, it takes the shortest route instead of traveling around the houses. The house the party sees the wisp move "into" is the Clergy House.
 
A few shelves line the inside of the upper closet. Against the back wall is a shelf with a locked lockbox. The weight of anyone of size medium or larger stepping into the room causes the floor to give way and the character falls to the first floor. Have that character make a DC15 Dexterity Saving Throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
 
If they do manage to get it, the box is old and can be broken into very easily by popping it open with decent leverage. Inside the box is 2d6gp 1d10sp 2d12cp and 2d4gp worth of miscellaneous gemstones.
 
```  
```
 
### Clergyman's House
 
If the players follow the child from the Farmer's House, they'll end up here in the Clergyman's House. The scripts you read to the players outline what should be read if they enter the room and what should be read if the peer through the windows first, as there are windows to each room. If the party didn't look through the windows to each room before entering, read the entering text first, then the peering text, unless otherwise stated.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**Main Room, read the peering text first**   **Peering in,** you see a broken table with four chairs around it, some of which are also broken. Other than that, the room is pretty bare. In addition to the front door, there is a door against the far wall away from the window and two perpendicular doors in the back.
 
**Entering the home,** you smell the savory smell of venison stew being cooked and hear soft, quiet sobbing from the behind door in the back facing you. Three triskelions adorn the walls around the room.  
</div>   <div class='descriptive'>  
**Girl's room and closet**   **Peering through this window,** you see a bed with mounded sheets, as though someone were sleeping under them. From this angle, you are unable to see the head side of the bed. In the opposite corner from the window, next to the door, is a miniaturized house.   **You enter the room** to find your daughter crying quietly on her bed. She is sat with her back up against her headboard and her face in her elbows. She is clutching her favorite burlap doll tightly, which hangs out the side. You try not to smile too visually at the sight of the flopping doll flailing side to side.   You stand in the doorway for a moment, thinking about what you'll say to her before making your way over and sitting down at the foot of her bed facing the window. You calmly drop your hand down and place it on her foot, petting it gently. You sit quietly for a moment until her sobs turn into small whimpers and then finally fades completely.   "Did it happen again?" A deep, baritone voice emanates from your throat. She nods her head slowly, her face still in her elbows. "Would you like for me to speak with her this time?" A moment passes as she ponders an answer. She heaves a heavy sigh and shakes her head slowly.
 
The vision fades and you stand in the doorway of a rickety room.  
</div>
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
The dollhouse is a replica of the Lackman Estate.
 
If anyone checks the closet, there will be the little girl that was outside the farmer's house cowering in the corner. This is the same little girl that could be seen outside of the window of the Inn and Tavern and the second floor of the farmer's house. She looks up, wiping away her tears, points to the shared wall towards the parents room and places a finger to her lips before fading away. A small burlap doll missing an eye button can be found in on the floor after she vanishes.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**Kitchen**   **As you try to look into through the window, make a perception check (DC12),** to those that pass, it's difficult to see in past what was once herbs drying in the window. Now the rot has spread to cover most of the window. You see a hearth in the corner by the door. Across from the hearth is a wash basin and prep area with a barrel next to it.   **Anyone entering** the kitchen makes a Wisdom saving throw **(DC15)**. Upon entering the kitchen, you look up at an enormous woman stirring the cauldron furiously. Your mother looks down at you and snarls an irate, "Get. Out!" You leave the kitchen crying. Those that passed uncover their faces as soon as they pass the threshold disoriented. Those that failed run despondently until you touch the far door. You who failed are shaken (-4) for 10 minutes.  
</div>
 
*Shaken (-n):* A shaken creature suffers a -n penalty to any attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws it makes where n equals the amount given in the parenthesis.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**Parent's Room and Closet**   **Peering into this room,** you see a two person bed with two figures beneath the sheets. Their dry, leathery heads resting on the pillows. A large chest sits at the foot of the bed and there are two doors in the room, one along the back wall, and one to the side of the bed.   **Entering the room,** you hear a man and a woman fighting through the wall to your right. You collapse to your knees and, with your hands clasped on your ears, start sobbing. You try your best to stay quiet because you know bad things will happen if your mother hears you. As soon as your knees touch the ground, the trunk in front of you slams shut, dissipating the vision in an instant.  
</div>
 
Ask for an investigation check(DC14) whenever someone opens the trunk. The first thing anyone will notice when they open the chest is a small burlap doll that is looking and pointing towards the door to the left (the closet door). If anyone moves, or otherwise tries to disturb the doll, its old seams give way and the burlap itself crumbles as it is moved. Under the doll are a few old sets of common clothes that also crumbles if moved. A successful investigation check reveals a false bottom. Removing it uncovers 1d4pp, 10d6gp, 2d8gp worth of gemstones, a healer's kit, a signet ring, candles, an ink pen and a bottle of midnight blue ink, and some blue sealing wax with silver specs.
 
When anyone touches the back door, have everyone roll initiative as a knife flies towards the head of the one that touched it. Roll an attack roll for the **poltergeist** +4 to hit, and deals 2d4 piercing damage.
 
The poltergeist attacks anyone that moves towards the closet door. If anyone touches or picks up the lockbox in the back, the poltergeist immediately uses its reaction to throw three knives at that person (+4 to hit, deals 2d4 piercing damage each). From then on, the poltergeist will only attack whoever is holding the box. If the key is taken out of the box, the poltergeist will prioritize the key over the box. The one who holds this item will continue to be attacked until they drop it, at which point the poltergeist will carry the key back to the box, if it's out, and then carry the box back to the closet.
 
The poltergeist will follow the characters out of the house.
 
### Cotton House, optional
 
This is the Cotton residence where Henry and Eleanor Cotton live. Henry was conscripted by Mistress Lackman to raise her children back from the dead. However, being the low level wizard he was, he didn't have access to any higher level spells like *raise dead* so he had to make do with the tools at his disposal.
 
He may have actually succeeded if not for the unfortunate grief Mistress Lackman felt for her children. This grief lead her to demand he research a fast solution. The longer he took, the more impatient she became. After a full year of research, proud that he finally created a working prototype of a lower level version of *raise dead*, he made the grave mistake of reporting this advancement before he could test it. She forced him, under threat of revealing him to the authorities, to perform the prototype ritual.
 
The ritual failed spectacularly, causing a blue shock wave to explode outward, extinguishing all life in the town, entrapping the townsfolk's spirits and turning them into the shadows, spectors, and residual hauntings that are seen today. The ritual, targeting children specifically, were all turned to Will-o'-Wisps.
 
The door handle on the right side door is an expired [invisibiliy potion](#p)
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
#### Cotton Study  
In the study can be found books and coded notes on the creation of Cotton's Soul Retrieval, as he named the working title of the prototype. The party can also find his personal journal, which is also coded using the same cipher as his notes, detailing his life when first arriving in Roslyndale right up to the night of the incident. Each entry includes a time marker of when the entry was made, feel free to change these markers to better suit your setting, or leave them as is for ease of reading.
 
Day 0
 
I was finally able to reach out to Dr Heward Lackman, a university professor that had hired me before for some of his experiments. We'd grown close in those times and I'd been trying to contact him for a while now. He said he'd be able to shelter me against the Sovereign Concordat for quite some time. In return, all I'd have to help him do was help him with some experiments and research from time to time. A small ask, to be honest.
 
Day 20
 
Heward left pretty soon after setting me up with a new identity, said he's going to an onsite research area. He's very closed off with me when it comes to his research. That's okay, it's his business, not mine. Being one who born with the gift of the arcane, he's asked me to extend my help to the rest of the village while he's gone. Should someone have a question about something magical, or just needs something magical to be done, I'm the guy to talk to. Being put up to this task from someone as renowned as Dr Lackman! I find it difficult to describe the excitement coursing through my veins.
 
Day 22
 
So, I was confronted today by Dr Lackman's wife, Mrs. Westra Lackman, on my being a refugee here. I hadn't realized that the doctor didn't tell anyone else about that. Apparently, I'm not the only one from whom he keeps his secrets. Their daughter, Silifrey, seems to have taken a liking to the Weird Magic Man in town that isn't her father and always asks many questions about the arcane. I'm happy to help. She reminds me of my sweet Lily, back home, who I miss terribly. Well, what I didn't realize is that she was gifted with limited telepathy. So when she called me by my real name to her mother the other day, Mrs. Lackman was duly puzzled. I tried my best to play it off but I knew it didn't work. So today, Mrs. Lackman knocks on my door while Eleanor, my simulacrum wife Dr Lackman made, was away, clenching a rolled parchment wearing an accusatory squint in her eyes. I knew from the moment she appeared on my doorstep that the parchment was a wolf's head poster with my face on it. I was finally able to calm her and she left uneasy but still willing to carry out the agreement between myself and her husband.
 
```  
```
 
> ##### From whom was Mr Cotton running?  
>  
> In my setting, sorcerer's are actively hunted and slain by what are known as witch hunters in the employ of the Sovereign Concordat, a massive, worldwide alliance between the human rulers of the world. Being a sorcerer himself, he sought refuge with an old friend.  
>  
> In your world, from whom was Mr. Cotton running?
 
Day 35
 
Well this has certainly been a big week and a half. The Concordat sent an agent here looking for me. Luckily my bloodline helps keep me hidden from witch hunters. It's very unnerving to stare in the face of someone hunting you. Can they see through this guise? Is today the day I am found? Turns out this was not the week I was to be found, thanks to some tricky wording from Mrs. Lackman. She kept me by her side the entire time to ensure I wasn't found. In addition to my blood, the good Dr apparently foresaw this occasion happening and put a few powerful wards in place to help shield my identity. And it worked. Really well. I'd seen others of my kind not fare so well face to face, as the best hunters can still find us with relative ease. I had assumed these were just new hunters, as I hadn't seen Dagon among their ranks. But now that I know about the wards, a lot of things makes sense. Anyways, off to sleep for me. I need my rest after this.
 
Day 45
 
Some of the townsfolk are starting to get sick. The innkeeper, Millie, asked me to look into the matter. When I told her I'm no healer, she responded that she knows I have magic. When pressed, it seems that she knows I am a refugee here. Apparently, she's part of a retired adventuring group known as The Grove, of whom the good Dr is also part. Her, Heward, Aranor the Jailor, Gorren the Chef at the estate, and one more after whom the statue in the cemetery was made. And they all know about my refugee status. They had been awarded this plot of land by Taoiseach Ratalan, himself, for good deeds done in the name of Erolyn and Baile as a whole. No wonder Heward has such good pull around here.
 
Day 50
 
I was grieved to learn that Westra's children, Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn, fell ill with this disease a few days ago. Many more villagers fell ill as well. I've been looking into ways to rid us of this, but so far no luck. Word got here today that the Bailen Council issued a state of emergency a short time ago. Apparently, this illness is infecting much of Baile in its entirety. The council also claims that this particular plague is resistant to magic. That explains why my efforts have largely been in vain. Luckily, my magic doesn't come from study nor some outside force or being, so this should give me some kind of edge. I hope. For now, I study.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
Day 56
 
Some of the villagers have started getting better. I'm not entirely sure if it's because of my efforts or because of their own ability to fend off illness. Unfortunately, those that haven't gotten better, have gotten far worse. I don't know if I'm able to turn it around at this stage. This includes the Lackman children. I'm continuing to take notes , but I'm afraid I may not be able to help this much past peoples' own abilities to heal themselves.
 
Day 61
 
The last of the villagers that got worse perished today. Every day since my last entry a couple people died. Then the sick children, including the Lackman children. First Kethra, then Branlyn, finally Silifrey. I loved them like they were my own. Normally in my grief I'd not be writing in a journal, were it not for the fact that there is something I need written down: Westra's sanity is slipping. I know she blames me for their passing. I can see it in the way she looks at me and in the way she talks to me. I don't know where this is going, but I can already tell I'm not going to like it.
 
Day 63
 
Westra asked me today if there was a way to bring people back from the dead and missing the social cues as usual, I stupidly told her that it was difficult but not impossible. When she asked if I could do it, mistake number two was made and I told her I might be able to figure it out but it would take some time to research as I don't have access to magicks that powerful. She asked me if it would help if I had access to some of the things her husband were working on. Without thinking, I said "absolutely!" Being able to have access to Dr Lackman's research was something I'd been working towards for quite some time. Hubris has always been my weakness, and the excitement from having access to the library of my idol is entirely unparalleled. But in truth, it would be very helpful. I told her to have the priest cast gentle repose on the children's bodies every ten days until I can come up with something safe.
 
Day 243
 
It's been six months since I started my research and she's really putting the pressure on me. She's threatening to tell the Concordat, but I keep telling her that magic doesn't work that quickly. I need to overcome two important problems: firstly, I'm trying to cast magic of which the ability requirements far outweigh my capabilities. And secondly, by all reasoning, I shouldn't be able to even perform this magic since my magic comes from my infused blood rather than a deity or patron that I'd petition to do the hard work for me. I need to find a way within my abilities to cast this spell, otherwise there's a very high chance of a catastrophic spell failure.
 
```  
```
 
Day 346
 
I'm finally getting close to a solution. I've studied the human body to the point where I feel comfortable knowing how all the processes function. If I can find an animal that died from this disease, I should be able to figure out how the disease killed its human hosts and be able to reverse the damage. Westra's giving me space at the moment, but I'm not sure how long that will last. Her sanity, and in turn, her humanity, is slipping. I'm afraid of what means she may turn towards in the coming days.
 
Day 405
 
Shortly after my last entry, I found a cat that had recently died from the disease and promptly started my experiments, with the aid of a gentle repose, of course. After a couple of months, I was able to reverse a considerable amount of damage to the point where I even got her tail to twitch. Soon I should be able to stabilize the spell and turn to human testing.
 
Day 424
 
I'm surprised how quickly I was able to stabilize the ritual on animals. I even tried it on a bird and was able to stabilize the ritual there, too. I'm ready to start human trials. Which is good, because today I made the mistake of telling Westra that I have a working, albeit unstable on humans, prototype. Her eyes lit up like low flames being fed after almost going out. She's now pressuring me to use it, but I was able to convince her that the chance of critical failure is still too high, so she allows me to continue, for now. The children continue to pass from this, so I should have plenty of test subjects. I can't wait for this nightmare to be over.
 
Day 467
 
She's really putting the pressure on me to finish the ritual. She even threatened to turn me into the Concordat! It's only been a month since I even found a way to partially stabilize the prototype! I'm able to bring back the animals, but they're mostly easy. Humans are much more complex. I've been able to stabilize the ritual only so much as to not eviscerate most the bodies, but no successful resurrections as of yet, and some of the bodies still get destroyed.
 
Day 474

We're doing it tonight. She stopped by this evening to show me papers indicating that she'd turn me in. Everything is in an exact way where she takes no blame for housing me. Luckily, I was able to stabilize the prototype further so the chance of failure is less. We'll start around an hour past midnight. Wish me luck.

# Church of Aelus, God of Agriculture
 
Aelus, the God who gifted Agriculture to mortals, has long been reveered as the savior of thinking creatures, especially the humans in this region of the world. This church is dedicated to his benevolence. The door to the shack is blocked from the otherside and, even though the door can be picked, it cannot be opened. The only other doors that cannot be entered are any of the door that lead to the Sanctuary. Any of these doors can only be opened with the key found in the Clergyman's house. No matter which door is walked through, the characters enter the Sanctuary through the front double doors. In which case, read the Sanctuary Scene.
 
The room to the left of the alter room is the pastor's room, if the characters enter this room, jump to the Pastor's Room scene. The room to the right is the extra room. Not much happens in there, though.  
```  
```  
#### Santuary
 
The santuary door can only be opened with the key found in the clergyman's house. Regardless of the stage of decay the townsfolk are in, everyone in the following scene is alive and well. When the party enters, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Sanctuary Scene  
**Start from here anytime the players have not unlocked the door**   You come to a large, elegantly carved door. Contrary to the surroundings, this door is as bright and new as the day it was finished and installed.   You place the key you found into the lock and it turns freely and the door opens into the church's spacious sanctuary.   **Start from here anytime after the first time the PCs have unlocked the double doors for that evening**   As you walk through the large double doors, you see an elegant arrangement of marble columns and granite surfaces. The walls are outlined with a fine golden trim, inlaid stairs are to your left and right inlaid with expensive woods, and cherrywood pews line the atrium up to a raised dais framed in by a low white ash wood fence and upon the dais sits an alter in the middle and a lectern on the left and right sides. Above the dais is a stone depression of Aelus, the God of Agriculture. There are two doors along the back wall to each side of the raised platform.   **Allanon, you smell a faint smell of ozone** as a woman approaches you all, "how kind of you to join us for the funeral during this time of morning. Come, come, sit with me and my husband. Are you friends of Mistress Lackman?"  
</div>   Pause here for a few minutes to give the players some time to talk to Eleanor Cotton. When roleplaying her, know that this is merely just a memory of when she was alive. She was a sweet, pious lady in her mid 50's married to Henry Cotton, the man who Mistress Lackman conscribed to bring her children back to life. Eleanor is not privy to the details of what Henry is doing to help the Lackmans, and she doesn't suspect adultery like the other townsfolk. Her altruistic motivation is simple in this memory, as it was in life: help others when needed, and help everyone who lost someone to the plague through the grieving process of these hard times. She knows everything under the rumormill section.   \page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
When the conversation starts to come to a close, or goes in circles, read the following box text to the players:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
After you finish talking, she leads you over to one of the pews where a man sits near the middle. "Henry, dear," she says to the man quietly as he stares solemnly towards the woman in black, not acknowledging the woman. "These are friends of the Lackman family **she lists off their names**, was it? They've come to pay their respects."   The pastor continues his speech as you look around and see a few other villagers. Off to your left is a giant bear of a man who sits a little ways away from you next to a smaller, more delicate woman holding an infant. You see to your right a bigger woman, her scouling face looks like the woman in the kitchen of the house in which you found the key. A little girl sits next to her. What do you do?  
</div>
 
If anyone asks for an insight check (DC10), it will reveal the girl is leaning away from the woman suggesting she is afraid.
 
After the scene plays out to its entirety, the party members are free to do whatever they wish.
 
#### Alter room  
The two doors along the back wall behind the dais lead to the decidedly run down section of the alter room. Read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Alter Room Scene   The new, fresh veneer of the sanctuary quickly turns cold as you step into this room. There is a door just beside you and another across the room. Four pillars frame a long table in the center just in front of you with two goblets are at each end and three plates run between them. One of the plates is smashed and the tapestry that ran the table under the dishware is old and rotted, with giant holes in it.   There is a massive statue in the back of the room high up on a dais, behind it a large, shattered stained glass scenery depicting fields of corn. Four other stained glass depictions suround the room and there are two brazers to the left and right of the statue. One of which, the left one, has crumpled with rust. There are two steps down behind the table pillars to a lowered area. A thick, heavy rope hangs from the tall ceiling, the bottom of which a few feet from the floor.  
</div>
 
Not much happens in this area. There is some rotten food on the plates and some long since dried wine in the goblets. The doors along the wall are unlocked. If the party goes through the door on the left, jump to the Pastor's Room Scene. If the party goes through the door on the right, jump to the Extra Room Scene. The doors to the exterior are locked and sealed until after they finish the bell tower scene.
 
When the party walks back through the doors to the sanctuary, the characters walk through the double doors of the front entrance. Reread the Sanctuary Scene box text as closely as you can to the first way you read it.
 
```  
```  
#### Second Floor
 
In the sanctuary are two staircases on the left and right of the main double doors leading to the second floor. The unconnected landings on either side look down over the sanctuary. This floor has three pairs of stained glass depictions detailing different scenes of agriculture. Towards the front by the entrance is a large, round topped, double wide stained glass depiction of Aelus giving tools and the gift of agriculture to mortals. Two smaller stained glass scenes frame the larger one portraying the first seeds being sewn into the ground.
 
When the party walks through one of the second floor doors, read the following box text:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Second Floor Scene
 
You walk into the room, There are two long, shallow tables along the back wall framing a ladder going up. Some dishware sits in the far left corner of that table and on the right is an ale cask with cups around it. A small container sits to the right of the cask with a book on top. Smaller, round stained glass scenes surround this room. There are two bookcases, one along the right wall, and one along the front wall by the door on the right. Next to the book case is a coffee table with a couch along the wall and three more comfortable chairs around it. The couch has soot in the vague shape of a humanoid lying across it. Ten chairs sit around a long table old and falling apart. Three of the chairs are also black with soot in vague humanoid shapes.   Two dark ghostly figures float about in this chamber, one in the back left corner, and one by the couch. They seem to be searching for something. As the one reaches towards the couch, it looks at you entering and gives a violent shreek as it lunges towards you. Roll Initiative.  
</div>
 
Roll initiative for the tutelae and four shadows. The four shadows, who were hiding on the couch and chairs act on round 2, leaving their space to focus on the tutelae first, before turning towards the party.
 
After the fight, there is a cacophonous boom from the floor above as a large dolorous churchbell gongs strongly. A large rope can be found in the corner of the room bobbing up and down threaded from the ceiling through the floor.
 
When the party walks back through the doors they entered to get into this room, the characters walk through the double doors of the front entrance. Reread the Sanctuary Scene box text as closely as you can to the first way you read it.   \page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
#### Bell Tower
 
When the party climbs the ladder to the floor above, read the following box text when they all have arrived:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Bell Tower Scene   Entering the trap door above the second floor, the first thing you see is a large bell hanging centered at the top, the bottom a couple feet above the floor. Connected to it is a thick, heavy rope that hangs down threaded into the floor to the room below.   Around the square room, you see four tall, glassless windows out of which the sound eminates. Out of the eastern window floats gently what looks to be an ethereal jellyfish rising and sinking serenly in the air.  
</div>
 
If anyone pulls the rope, the bell swings side to side, getting higher and higher, until the clapper strikes one side releasing a mighty gong. The bell swings to the other side and the clapper strikes to release a second gong. This continues for as long as the characters keep the momentum. Once they stop, the bell will sound one extra time before the swing is not strong enough to complete another. Anyone in the bell tower when the bell tolls makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for the next minute.
 
If the party rings the bell, the jellyfish moves towards the characters, traveling through the ceiling to get to the one that looks the squishiest, where it makes a tendril attack on one of the characters. Describe the attack as it gently encompassing the target's body. If the attack misses, it just sits there around the creature. If it hits, the pain similar to being bit by a potent jellyfish in the ocean, the target's muscles convulsing and withering as it takes 2d8+4 necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6. **Remember: dybbuks are intelligent creatures (Int score of 16). So it can likely figure out which character has the lowest AC.** After dealing this damage once, or being damaged itself, it will vanish in a puff of purple smoke as it casts dimension door on itself.
 
Children can be heard playing on the ground after the dybbuk vanishes. Peering over the side, there are three running around playing a game. A sourceless voice calls to them sounding distressed, "come children, quickly before those creatures return! Quit playing around!" the voice calls desparately. A successful perception check (DC 11) tells the characters that the sourcless voice calls from the shack.
 
If this is still the first night from the Arrival, I'd recommend having the sun rise and rubberbanding the characters back to the Wandering Flower and starting the second day.
 
When the party climbs back down the ladder and walks through either of the doors on the second floor, the characters walk through the double doors of the front entrance. Reread the Sanctuary Scene box text as closely as you can to the first way you read it.  
```  
```  
#### Pastor's Room
 
If the party attempts to follow the voice, they may end up in the pastor's room connected to the left side of the alter room. The outside door to this area is now unlocked. If they do choose this room, read the following box text to the players:
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Pastor's Room Scene   A man in vestiges writes fervently at a desk in the near corner by the door. He doesn't seem to notice your entry. There's a bed to your left and a shelf holding some personal affects. Along the back wall is a low cabinet to the left of a door and a bookcase to the right, next to the man at the desk.   **As you walk foward,** his whole body whirls around and his eyes glare deeply into yours as you feel a chill flashes down you spine. You blink and he is gone for an instant before grabbing your arms from behind and spins you around staring intently into what seems like your soul, "Evil Infests This Godly Town!" His voice booms with multiple coinciding tones, like three people speaking at once. You take **1d10** necrotic damage as you feel his cold hand chill you to your bones. You look down in a panic as you feel your muscles wither aging you **1d6** years. You back up from fright and he is gone. You can still feel his grip on your arm and you look down to see a burn in the shape of a hand print.  
</div>
 
Everything in this room is rotted. If anything is handled, it crumples and falls apart.
 
#### Extra Room
 
This room is pretty inconsequential. This is a resting quarters for guests and the weary. It has two beds, some night stands, and a table on the opposite side with some dishware. Feel free to put something here if you wish. In my run, I wanted one thing to be not dangerous, just to put the players on edge, expecting something to be here.
 
#### Basement
 
After the bell tower scene, when the party leave the church (remember to replay the Sanctuary Scene anytime they enter it no matter which door they enter from), they immediately hear a woman scolding the children they heard and saw after dealing with the jellyfish. They then hear a large metal door slam as the players round the western corner. The door that they heard shut was the door to the shack around the corner that leads to the undercroft. The door is now unlocked and unblocked as the nun hadn't resecured the door before running after the returning children.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Basement scene   You see a landing at the foot of what you can now see is a dark switchback staircase. What do you do?   **When you reach the landing,** the light bounces from the upper floor allowing you to look around the corner and see at the base of the staircase a wall 10 feet away from the base and a sharp left and a sharp right.   **Arriving at the bottom,** you see the right ends at another wall, and the left follows into an open room 20 feet away. It's too dark to see into without assistence. **Those with darkvision roll a perception check (DC15).** *Whisper to the players that pass and tell them they see a statue at the other end of the large room standing on a tall dais, then turn to the players that failed.* You all see a figure at the end of the hall. Tall. Intimidating. It's a little too dark to see any more detail. *Get a marching order.*   **The end of the hall** opens into a large domed, circular room. *Roll some dice for effect then turn to the one in front:* as you enter this room you catch a the head of broom to the face for...2 points bludgeoning damage. A woman in a habit stands in the doorway crying in fear, "stay away! Stay away!"  
</div>
 
The domed, circular room at the end is 40 feet in diameter. On the left and right are a couple benches and in the middle at the back is an alter to Aelus. Some storage crates and barrels are also in the room with random stores of supplies, ale, wine, and non perishable food for the clergy staff all of which now rotten.
 
The party can easily calm Beatrice Codlack the nun and learn from her some information. What she knows is outlined in the sidebar. She also knows information in the [Rumormill](#p6) section. As Bea starts to calm down, they'll see some children poke their heads out of hiding places, curious who she's talking to. It's difficult to place how many children there are hiding.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
**On a downbeat,** the door upstairs is heard slamming open, some of the crates fall and shatter. "You didn't block the door?!" Exclaims the woman frantically.  
</div>
 
The characters have 1-2 rounds to get into positions before a pack of wolves gets to the bottom of the staircase. The amount of wolves depends on how many players are at the table and how low they are from the second floor fight. The wolves are meant to be a short, easy fight as a harder one is possibly coming up right behind it. The wolves, as the party can see clearer now they are close, are undead. Skin rots and falls off their corpses. In reality, these are possessed by dybbuks, as are all the undead they'll fight around the churchyard.
 
After the party has disposed of the wolves, if they return to the storage room, the nun and children are gone. Instead, floating in the space of the children are Will-o'-Wisps. The amount of wisps are equal to one more than the amount of characters in the party. This is meant to be a difficult encounter. Each of the wisps that die drop a pearl.   ```  
```
 
> ##### Bea's Info, from her perspective  
>  
> - She and the children saw the ethereal jellyfish just before they sank into the ground.  
> - Wolves were attacking the church. Some of the wolves were dead.  
> - Just after the wolves attacked, some of the corpses of the recently burried rose from their graves, including her father, Tyrian Codlack.  
> - She then quickly rounded up the children and fled here to the undercroft, blocking the door.  
> - Most of the corpses were not burried here in the graveyard. They were burried in the cemetery down the way.
 
##### Ambush
 
Upon leaving the basement, the party encounters 1d3 dybbuk humanoid corpses and 1d4+1 wolf corpses. One of the humanoid corpses is that of Beatrice Codlack.

# Cemetery
 
Roslyndale Cemetery houses the majority of the town's deceased. Surrounded by a low stone wall, the only entrance is a lychgate to the south. The tutelae have cleared the cemetary of the presence of the dybbuks so the cari can complete their task, so only they, in terms of bad guys to fight, will be found here. The biggest time rift in the cemetery occurs in the mausoleum itself to the left, so when the party first enters the cemetery, that's where they'll be. Since the only possibility for combat is in the very small mausoleum, there was no real need for a full map of this area.
 
Against the northern wall is a statue depicting a hooded, cloaked figure with a feminine silhouette, head down to obscur the face, the hands are conceiled within the large holed sleeves placed in front of the figure's body. To the right is a clearing with more tombstones where an optional encounter that is more lighthearted. Open graves are dotted around the cemetary where the dybbuks rose the corpses.
 
If one of the characters experienced the opening dream, these are recognizably the same locations in the cemetery part of the dream, though what actually stands here are a little different, as outlined in the following sections. The light from the moons shine brightly, illuminating the cemetery in a dim light.
 
#### The Dead Cherry Tree
 
When the party enters the cemetery through the lychgate and continues north, they see a long dead cherry tree sat in the middle of a clearing. This is the same dead cherrywood tree as seen in the vision. A few long dead lanterns hang from the branches. To the north is a path leading to a statue, from which a quiet sobbing can be heard. The west leads to a mausoleum, two figures can be seen carved into the side of the marble building and something is carved above the extra wide ornately carved red wood door. The east leads to a clearing where a figure can be seen milling about aimlessly. These are the same locations that were in the vision dream, though there are differences, some clear, some subtle.
 
#### Statue Path
 
A statue stands against the northern wall of the cemetery, about 30 feet from the cherry tree.
 
The girl is Silifrey Lackman, as she will proudly proclaim if asked, the eldest Lackman child. At the time of their death, Silifrey was 13 years of age.
 
>##### The Queen's Elegy  
>  
> The statue is of Queen Milla, Goddess Queen of the Afterworld, where it is believed in this region the spirits go after death. The plaque at the bottom of the statue reads:  
>  
> Oh come ye tired and weary!  
>  
> All ye who toil days long in the soil.  
>  
> All ye who art in anguish and despair.  
>  
> Come unto mine arms, mine breast,  
>  
> Mine loving embrace.  
>  
> Rest child.  
>  
> Sleep now and be still,  
>  
> For thou hath toiled long enough in thine soil.  
>  
> Grant me thine soul to cradle anon.  
>  
> Eternity's winds do carry thee on.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Statue Encounter   Ahead of you stands a marble statue characterizing a cloaked hooded figure with a feminine silhouette. Her hood drawn far in front of her face obscuring it from view. Her hands folded into her large bell sleeves, concealed and placed to her front. There is a plaque at the base that is a bit too far to read.   As you approach the statue, a young girl is seen weeping silently to herself, her visage is hollow and transparent. She doesn't stir at your approach. What do you do?   **It doesn't take much to get the girls attention. When they do, describe their action, then the following:**   Startled, the girl jumps up to her feet, taking a regal stance. She wipes away her tears saying, "my apologies for making such a display of my emotions. Mother always says, 'a Lady should never show her mind in front of strangers.'"  
</div>
 
When asked why she cries, she'll respond saying, "There are monsters in my house," she points to the mausoleum then continues, "I've tried talking to them and I've tried fighting them. But they don't answer me nor respond to my...um...aggression." She sounds out the word as she speaks it.
 
#### Mausoleum
 
The Lackman Mausoleum interior is a 30 foot by 30 foot square. Although Westra and Heward are the first Lackmans in Roslyndale and the parents are buried elsewhere, the walls are about two and a half feet thick to give enough room for family interment. Currently, the interment slots are all empty.
 
Until filled, the slots were designed as shelves for decoration and can be altered as needed if more space is required.
 
It's original design was intended to be able to hold 15 adult bodies in each full wall, and 6 adult bodies along the entrance wall for a total of 51 adult bodies along the walls.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Mausoluem Encounter   You enter the mausoleum and see around you frosted stained glass lining the walls, barred from the inside likely intended to deter graverobbers. Five stone caskets rest on the floor and there are many openings in the walls to allow for the interment of many generations.   Over three of the caskets are legless shades with drawn hoods. A blue magical light eminates from their hands to the caskets they hover above. As you walk in through the heavy door, the one in front turns swiftly in your direction, holding a lantern with hideous faces twisted in agony towards you. The girl runs away screeming in horror.   After a moment, the shade looks at the lantern, shakes it, then points it back at the party. A moment later when nothing happens, it places the lantern on the casket it is above, and takes a defensive stance, as do the others. What do you do?  
</div>
 
These are the zeitgeists, whos stat blocks can be found in the appendices. Their mission here is to heal the time rift that keeps Roslyndale in the loop it currently plays out. Meaning that if left alone long enough, say roughly a few hundred years, everything about this hellscape *should* resolve itself.
 
These tempus cari, as they are truly called, are taking the dodge action. They aren't looking to fight, but, in not knowing the character's intentions, they are getting ready in case the players attack.
 
The cari try everything in their power to stay in the material plane, as if they leave, they'll lose their progress for the day and will have to start over. Hence why the beefier and more combat adept tutelae are sent to an area first to clear out any potential threats.
 
As the cari are defeated, they blink out of existence, their bodies transported to the identical area in the ethereal plane, where they must wait for their bodies to reform before returning to Roslyndale and beginning again. The lantern that the cari placed down is the Tombtaker's Lantern, see the appendices for its stats.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### After scene   After defeating the creatures, the girl enters the mausoleum once more, "Th-thank you," she says meekly, before clearing her throat and straightening up, "my sister made some boots for me some time ago. I'd like you to have them as a reward."   She walks over to a smaller, child sized casket, "BOO!!" another ghostly girl springs out of the casket, startling the first, "did I scare you?" She exclaims playfully.   "Kitty! What are you doing in my bed again?" She demands of the second child.   She looks down, dejected, "Those monsters scared me so I came to find you." An infant's cry can be heard coming from another casket.   "Kitty, now you woke Branlyn." the first says to her.   "Sorry Frey," Kitty looks down apologetically.   </div>   ```  
```
 
<div class='descriptive'>   Frey moves over to the casket and lifts the boy out, cradling the infant, "there, there bean. Your sisters have you." Kitty walks over to Frey and pets the boy's head.   Kitty gestures over to the party, "These nice people scared off the monsters! Say thank you!"   All three fade from view as they rock and pet the boy trying to calm him. A cooing can be heard for a moment after they fade completely.  
</div>   The boots are in whichever casket the players go to. These are the Wind Runners, and you can find stats for them in the appendices.
 
#### Scullery Maid Encounter
 
When the party leaves the cemetery, a woman, Ellian, approaches the group, distraught. As she draws near, the group can see through her visage, this is another ghost. She exclaims that there are scary happenings at the Lackman House, where she works. If the players take the time to interrogate her, she gives her knowledge freely without issue:  
- This is one of the house maidens, specifically one of the scullery maids.  
- She was working towards a promotion and pay raise before the happenings started  
- Mr. Cotton has been coming to the house regularly, then her and the Mistress both go to Mr. Lackman's laboratory on the third floor.  
- Mr. Cotton arrived sometime after midnight, which is unusual and, after some time, strange lights and sounds started to occur and she ran away in fright.  
- Her father rests here and the cemetery and this is where she escapes to when she needs some time to herself, hence why she came here in her fright.  
- She knows that the Mistress hired Mr. Cotton to help her research something, not sleeping with eachother as others would suggest. She does not know the nature of this research.
 
#### Eastern Part of the cemetery, optional
 
In the eastern part of the cemetery, by the clearing, is a fully clothed skeleton very conspicuously rummaging through the grass, lifting stones, and digging shallowly into the ground looking for a shoe. This encounter is entirely optional, but it's intended to be a light-hearted encounter to lift the otherwise dreadful tone of the rest of this adventure. Feel free to have the skeleton notice the party as they are leaving.
 
If it notices the party, it will wave them down in an attempt to ask for help. Its lower jaw will move up and down as it does, but, being a creature without skin or a voice box, no sound comes out.
 
If the party approaches, choose a character and have the skeleton look excitedly at that character's feet and make grabby-gimme hands. A successful perception, insight, or similar check reveals that it is missing a shoe.
 
Let this encounter play out as it does. The skeleton has on its person a Coin of Fate (Holy Moiety coin from Dr Law's Rare Rediculous Relics.)

# The Lackman Estate
 
The Lackman House, the epicenter of the ritual that desecrated the entire town, leaving it the strange reflection it is today, has been affected far more devastingly than the rest of the town. Time moves slower inside the house, as a whole, giving the party less time to explore the house before being cast out the following day, as they have experienced many times at this point. However, time moves at a different rate in every room, which is outlined in the room sections.
 
The temporal shift is active regardless what time of day the players visit the estate and each section will have descriptions for what the characters should expect to experience if they visit during day hours or night hours. The players are only shunted back to the inn beds when the sun rises. A player looking out a window while in the house can make a perception check (DC12) to notice that the sky is moving noticeably faster than normal, as are the trees whose branches are blowing in the wind.
 
## Border Ethereal
 
After sunset, the interior of the house fades to the border ethereal plane, though the exterior walls continue to sit in between both the border ethereal and prime material planes. This means that anyone can enter the house, but leaving is a bit more difficult.
 
Looking out through a window, a character sees what the character should expect to see. It's when attempting to exit the house in anyway, whether through a window or exterior door, that things get strange. Up to 60 feet from the house is a colorless landscape that reflects the normal landscape. About 60 feet away from the house is a massive wall of thick fog that surrounds the perimeter.
 
Anyone that ventures into the fog can look back to see the house becoming increasingly smaller, the further away they go until they eventually lose sight of the house. If anyone does this, they are completely removed from the rest of the group for the remainder of the evening as they become hopelessly lost in between the border and deep ethereal planes. Although, they will wake up the following day with the rest of the party.
 
```  
## Running the Estate, optional
 
If the party enters the estate at night, adjudicate about how many hours are left until sunrise, before the time dilation, and set a timer for ⅔ that amount of time. The description for each room has a time dilation tag. Multiply that number by the amount of time spent in that room. If the time dilation is more than 1, subtract the resulting number from the time remaining until sunrise. If the time dilation is less than 1, add the resulting number to the time remaining until sunrise. If a room or area doesn't have a time dilation number, the time dilation defaults to 1. It's helpful to use a counting up timer and to pause the timer when you take a moment after the party leaves a room to do your calculations.
 
Pause the timer when reading box text and during combat. For every 10 non-continuous rounds of combat, subract 1 minute from the time remaining.
 
##### A helpful chart for converting between hours and minutes:  
| Hours | Minutes | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  
|:-----:|:-------:|  
| 1 | 60 |  
| 2 | 120 |  
| 3 | 180 |  
| 4 | 240 |  
| 5 | 300 |  
| 6 | 360 |
 
As an example, the party enters the house through the main entrance with 6 hours of night remaining, start a counting up timer. The party has 4 hours before sunrise. They take a few minutes to inspect the entry hall then make a right into the library and trigger the residual haunting combat which lasts 3 rounds. Make note that the party have used 3 rounds.
 
Afterwards, they spend about 7 real time minutes searching through the library, which has a time dilation of 3, then leave back into the corridor. Multiply 3 and 7 to get 21 then subtract 21 from the original 4 hours (240 minutes) to get 3 hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes) and 7 rounds of combat remaining.
 
When they are finished in the library, they head over to the event hall and spend 10 minutes looking around. Multiply 10 by the event hall's time dilation of ½ to get 5 then add the result to the remaining time to get 3 hours, 44 minutes (224 minutes), and 7 rounds of combat remaining.  
```
 
## Ambient Residual Haunting
 
During Dr. Lackman's excursions, the butler, Mr. James Mallard, and the house keeper, Ms. Lillian Buchanon, became the de facto guardians and protectors of the house. After the spell failure ripped through the town, most of the staff still haunt the Lackman house, going about their duties. In the final scene of the dream, when the character was being walked to the room at the end of the hallway as the Mistress, the man walking beside them was the butler. Any time the butler is mentioned, feel free to remind the player that experienced the dream that he seems very familiar.
 
Residual Hauntings are outlined in the rooms, but the butler and house keeper are ever present. If any character looks into a mirror they will likely see the two eerily standing over their shoulder, staring. Glimpses of the two can also be seen out of the corners of the characters eyes.
 
For every hour spent in the estate, night or day, have any living creature make a Constitution saving throw (DC13) or gain 1 level of exhaustion and age 2d4 years as the butler and house keeper drain the their energy and life.

> ##### The Lackman Children  
>  
> Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn Lackman were the three children that Westra lost to the plague that swept through the town. If the party visited the mausoleum in the cemetery, these are the children they interacted with. Silifrey was 15 years of age, Kethra was 9, and Branlyn 6th birthday had just passed.  
>  
> The party will be seeing much of these children throughout the estate.  
>
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
## [Ground Floor](#p24)
 
This is the estate's living space. Many things are found on this floor, as described in the following sections, from areas for entertaining guests to more personal spaces for escaping the public eye. There are even a few water closets (WC on the map).
 
A wide cobblestone path leads up to the main entryway framed by two grand pillars. Two massive, ornately carved double doors stand proudly, both doors together depict what look to be a battle between two sides. A successful arcana or history check (DC15) reveals this to be the scene of the titans and betrayer gods on the bottom right corner of the right door against the modern day gods on the bottom left corner of the left. At the top is carved a celestial script that spans the two doors. On the left door translates roughly to, "the are no gods" then continues to the right door, "only very powerful beings." In the center spanning both doors is one figure carved larger than the others looking up in agony. A successful, but more difficult, arcana check (DC25) reveals this to be Diven, the titan Mr. Lackman and a few of his collegues believe to be responsible for rallying the other titans and betrayer gods against the modern day gods, just before being violently fragmented.
 
This is forshadowing for the riddle that the characters will eventually have to solve in order to enter the attic and end the curse.
 
Entering the estate at night, the sky lights up in the distance and a loud crack of thunder is heard followed by a low rumbling. Rain starts begins to thrum loudly against the roof and the sides of the house. If you can, play some heavy rain sounds.
 
### [Entrance Hall](#p24)
 
Locked during the day, the two massive, artfully carved double doors described above lead into a lavish entry hall with decadent tapestries hanging artistically on the walls. A hearth is to the left with a family painting hanging above it. To the right is a set of glass double doors leading out to a veranda. In the back, marking the start of the hallway, are two nicely carved load bearing pillars. There is a heavy wooden door next to the glass door.
 
> ##### Kethra Lackman  
> Kethra was gifted with clairvoyance. This was made stronger by the spell failure that had outstretching consquences creating a fractured point in time where anyone in or around the house and its grounds can losely interact with others regardless of native time period, especially those who are sensitive to such disturbances.  
>  
> Troughout her life, short as it was, she frequently saw many spirits and phantoms. Most of her family and staff accounted this as a child's imaginary friends, regardless of the fact that she had so many of them.  
>  
> She's always had a knack for tinkering and building things and loved mixing magical and mechanical gadgets and contraptions.  
>  
> Her favorite colors were crimson red and natural silver.
 
At night, the hall will be more decrepit. The tapestries will have torn from their own weight over time. Some of the stones in the hearth are cracked and the painting above it droops. One of the load bearing pillars is cracked, leading to the possibility of the upper floor collapsing at some point.
 
### [Ground Floor Corridors](#p24)
 
As with many of the walls throughout the house, the ground floor corridors are covered with different paintings, marble carved busts, tapestries, and other styles of art that were sourced from within the village of Roslyndale.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Ground Floor Verandas](#p24)
 
Not much is found on the verandas other than alternate ways into the estate. They mostly serve as another memory of when the estate was alive and well, but can be utilized to peak into other areas for reconnaissance before enterring. When the characters step out onto a veranda at night from within the estate, pause the timer to read the corresponding box text, then drop the players out of the memory, start the timer again, and let them decide where to go next. The first time the party is physically outside, refer to the [Border Ethereal](#p22) section to describe what they see as they interact with the outdoors.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Entry Hall  
It's a brisk, cloudy day as you step out onto the veranda. You walk over to the glass table in the center. It's been an exciting week as you finally take a seat in your new home. You and Heward have been planning this for years and it's finally here. An espresso sits on the table. You squeeze the lemon zest into it and watch your movers carry in Heward's bar globe. A few moments later, his rolltop desk is moved in as well. You sip the espresso and feel the warmth as it travels down your throat.   The vision fades leaving you standing on the terrace. The warmth of the espresso still in your belly slowly fades with it.  
</div>  
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Library / Event Hall  
Spectral dancers twirl and shimmer resplendently under the moonlight as a warm breeze brushes gentle against your faces. Some veranda furniture is also set up with people sitting in chairs enjoying tea and wine and ale, reading books and talking, though no sound is heard. The phantasmal dancers seem completely unaffected as they dance through the furniture and seated guests.   Two girls skip up to one of the seated pair, one of whom holding an infant. One girl looks to be 13 wearing a blue dress with gold colored trim, the other appears to be about 7 wearing a red dress with silver trim. The infant appears to be a few months from 2 years. The two speak to the pair, though no sound is heard. Their body language says they need help with something and the ghostly forms of the pair stand, excuse themselves and follow the children through one of the bordering doors against the shorter wall and vanish into the next room.  
</div>   The three children are Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn Lackman. The pair they speak to are their parents, Heward and Westra Lackman.

<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Arcade  
A storm starts to gather as you finish your game of Nine Men's Morris with Westra. She has beaten you yet again, though what else were you expecting when you knowingly make a few bad moves. She bounds up in excitement with her victory as a gentle rain begins to fall and the two of you move the board and chairs against the house. She doesn't seem to have noticed that you've been losing on purpose to encourage her to play more.   For you, it's not about winning, it's about being with your beloved wife. Being as learned and intrepid as you are, along with your work that forces you to travel far and for long periods of time, you need to make every moment count with your family that you can for one day, you fear, you may not return.   You stand watching the rain drop into your fountain, your arms around Westra and smoke rising from your pipe, knowing this fragile peace is not far from being broken. The vision fades and you feel this peace resound through your entire being.   Until you finish your next long rest, you have advantage on all wisdom saving throws and are immune to the frightened condition.  
</div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Dining Room  
It's a beautiful mid-morning day today as you step out onto the veranda from your dining room. You're still relatively new to the village, but you love it here all the same. Just you, your husband, and your daughter. The tree line in the distance sparkles brilliantly as the morning dew finishes evaporating off the leaves. You see your fountain in your garden in the back and smile as Heward's voice calling from within the house, "I'll be right out darling. Just putting together a little something for Silifrey."  
</div>
 
### [Library ](#p24)
 
The library was a place Mr Lackman could keep books that didn't need to be kept secreted away from prying eyes. He would bring his children here and teach them the ways of magic and wizardry. Silifrey was the most adept of the two that were old enough to study such wonders. Kethra was more of a scientist who loved toying with taking everything apart and "improving" them, often trying to mix the mundane with the magical. Any of the staff or public was allowed in the library to read or withdraw books as long as they were returned and thus was never locked.
 
A large, heavy dictionary sits on a pedestal in the middle of the room made to cradle large, heavy tomes. A hearth is to the right with three chairs surrounding it. A Heaven's Chronical sits on a table near the bay window next to a Star Gazer (telescope worth 2,000gp) and star gazing journal. This was one of his prized possessions and he enjoyed showing it off to people whenever he could. Being the powerful mage he was, he wasn't concerned with someone stealing these treasures as he'd very easily be able to find the thief.
 
When the party first enters the room, there can be seen an older man sitting in one of the chairs reading. This is not Mr Lackman. When the characters enter the library for the first time each visit, the man slowly looks behind him, bones cracking and popping as he does, and states, "you are not welcome here!" He stands swiftly and lifts his arms, vanishing as he looks upwards and books start flying off the shelves. Roll initiative as swarms of books attack the players.
 
### [Event Hall](#p24)
 
Countless memories were made here and time always seemed to slow while in this hall, which was used for a great many events, from after wedding parties and funeral gatherings to celebrations of life and the seasons. Once every year, the Lackmans would also hold a masked ball for the village residents, to boost morale. The Lackmans would put up their old dresses and suits for rent as well as pay the village mills to put their textiles on sale as villagers were encouraged to attempt to make their own outfits.
 
At night, when the characters walk in, in addition to a more ragged scene depicted above, they see masked spirits dancing an older dance in suits and large dresses. A successful perception check reveals the clothing is slightly mismatched. Some have clothing that's too big, others have ripped, or amateurly tailored clothing. A band stands on a portable 10ftx5ft stage on the eastern side of the room by the large window. Neither the band, the spirits and the stage can be interacted with in any way.
 
### [Parlour](#p24)
 
This room was mostly used in life as a means to entertain guests while the Lackmans finished up with the preceeding appointment. In here can be found some books on a table for reading next to the couch and chairs by the hearth, two pedestals along the back wall showcasing magic items, as well as a chess set enchanted to play the opposing color with a few different difficulty settings. In the left pedestal is a leather cuff adorned with rune eched bones and the bottom jaw of an animal (See Elder Cuff in the appendix). In the pedestal on the right holds a sack of magic coins.
 
At night, the only things that aren't run down are the magic items in the since broken cases and the chess table and chairs. If anyone is ever within 5ft of the chess set, namely to get to the magic items, the chess set moves ash king's pawn to D4. **Wait to see if anyone sits at the table willingly to play.**
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
If no one sits down at the table, have everyone that witnesses this move make a DC15 Charisma saving throw. Of those that failed, the one that rolled the lowest is compelled to sit on the black side and play. Anyone else that failed is compelled to watch the game unfold.
 
#### [Playing Chess](#p24)
 
Have the character that is playing chess and the chess set itself roll three opposing Intelligence checks. The chess set is set to the Grand Master difficulty setting, Mr. Lackman's favorite, and gets a +8 bonus. If the character is proficient in chess, they may add their proficiency modifier.
 
If the character accumulates 3, they win, on 2 successes, there is a stalemate, and if they accumulate only 1 success, they lost the game. In either case, record the difference in the opposing rolls, with the player wins being positive, and the chess set's wins being negative. At the end of the match, add up the cumulative difference and refer to the corresponding win/loss charts that follow to know the reward or penalty.
 
For the sake of storytelling, when calling for Intelligence rolls while playing chess, describe the outcome of the rolls in between each roll to build tension, instead of calling for the rolls all at the same time.

### [Study](#p24)
 
This is where Mr. Lackman relaxed and enjoyed his time away from everything. His experiments, entertaining guests, and general runnings of the household. After he was finished with his reponsibilities, he would come here to cool down, have a drink and a smoke, and write. Short stories, daily thoughts, journaling. This was his space.
 
On occasion, he loved sharing this room with his children, whom he cherished dearly. The only rule he had was to never enter this room without him, as he placed a magical trap on the room that, because of the spell failure, could be dangerous.
 
In this room can be found his bar globe with what were fine liquors and wine all in crystal decanters and a few glasses, a writing desk of inspiration, the stats should you need them are in the appendix, next to which sits a Heward's Handy Haversack, and three locked bookcases with magical tomes held within. A few magical book examples can also be found in the appendix.
 
When the party first enters this room, pause the Estate timer and read the following box text first then start a 5 minute timer and refer to the chart to see how high the water rises after each minute. This is designed to be instill terror as they live through this trap. The doors and windows are magically sealed during the 5 minutes and cannot be opened or broken by any means.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
##### Study Description   As you step into the room, you hear a k-tik as the door closes gently behind you. The wall to your left is lined with caged bookcases and a weathered roll top desk sits centered on the right side of the room between to large windows and under a grand landscape picture depicting Veraudinus and his siblings Aide and Minuris dancing resplendently across the sky, shining brilliant light onto the treetops and a glistening lake. A fireplace is in the corner just to your right with a chair in front, another caged book case sits between it and you. In front of you stands another grand bay window, this time with a chair and globe in front of it.   A moment after taking in the interior of this room, a blinding flash of light enters from the windows as a loud cacophonous roar explodes above the estate **(make a thunder sound if you can)** almost deafening. The drumming of the rain becomes heavier and heavier. As the bay window begins to leak, you look down and find yourselves standing in low water. Looking behind you, water begins pouring through the doors as well. Water starts to spew from the books and from the paintings. The room is filling quickly, the water level rising. What do you do?  
</div>
 
In this, there is no way out but through. That being said, always reward clever thinking. This completely suppresses all magic designed to change someone's form, and as such wildshaping and polymorphing doesn't work here.
 
Additionally, the trap was only designed to deter curious minds, but because of the spell failure, the magic warped and now frightens.
 
> ##### Who was Mister Lackman?  
>  
> He's not widely spoken of in this tale and plays only minor roles in it. In my setting, he is one of my major wizards of power who often left town in search of many wonderous items and magical studies.
 
In the following chart, everything is relative to the average human height  
##### Water Height  
| Minute | Height |  
|:------:|:------:|  
|1|The bay window bursts and water is up to the knees  
|2|Water pours in from the hearth, the bookcases, and the globe and the water is now up to the navel  
|3|The other windows burst open and the level is up to the shoulders  
|4|The doors burst open as the water rises above their heads  
|5|The water level is now up to the ceiling  
|6|Read the following box text
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
#### Aftermath  
**Speak slowly and softly**   After a few moments, you release your last breath, and your arms go slack. First Yg. Then Allanon. Finally Dampé. One by one each of you lose consciousness as you feel yourselves descend slowly towards the floor.   **Wait a few moments before continuing**   As you descend your bodies right themselves feet down and you land gently on the floor. You take a look around and see the wall to your left is lined with caged bookcases and a weathered roll top desk sits centered on the right side of the room between to large windows and under a grand landscape picture depicting Veraudinus and his siblings Aide and Minuris dancing resplendently across the sky, shining brilliant light onto the treetops and a glistening lake. A fireplace is in the corner just to your right with a chair in front, another caged book case sits between it and you. In front of you stands another grand bay window, this time with a chair and globe in front of it.  
</div>
 
At this point, the PCs are free to interact with the study as they wish. The doors and windows are no longer locked or sealed and can be opened freely.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Chapel Ground Floor](#p24)
 
Inside this room are ashwooden pews that line the floor with a narrow walkway leading up to a rather large altar framed by two massive stained glass windows depicting scenes of agriculture much like in the church. There are three doors around the chamber, two leading to the hallway and one leading to the study.
 
This room was a place of worship for the Lackman staff. Ceremonies were also held here, such as blessing's, funeral rites, and weddings. It basically served as another, smaller church, giving residents another option for whatever is needed.
 
At night, ask everyone entering the room to make a dexterity saving throw except for any that benefit from the web walker feature, as the entire room is covered in a thick layer of webs. The area is considered lightly obscured (perception checks and attacks rolls relying on sight are made with disadvantage) and is difficult terrain in all directions, including vertically. The storm outside begins to beat down on the house more heavily.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
##### Ground Floor Scene  
Those who failed the save immediately walk right into a thick layer of webs. Looking through the webs is very difficult as it lightly obscures everything around you, though you can faintly make out wooden pews and some kind of altar along the back wall. Through the webs you hear a child in the far corner screaming in fright, "no! Not you too!"
 
You hear a door slam open to your right and young footsteps run over to the girl, "Kitty! Kitty! Wake up! You're having another phantasm! Wake up!"
 
Hissing and clicking descend from above as the girl screams once more pointing upwards, "they're coming!"
 
Roll Initiative!
 
**During the fight, Kitty will say something along the lines of, "these are different, Frey. They are fighting the monsters. I think these ones are here to save us!"**  
</div>
 
The first girl is Kethra and the second is Silifrey. When together, they are both in the far corner away from any of the doors.
 
> ##### Silifrey Lackman  
>  
> Like her sister who was gifted with clairvoyance, and her father who was gifted with telekenesis, Silifrey was gifted with telepathy, which she often used to sus out who was lying and what was the actual truth. Lies to her were an abomination and she was exceptionally vocal when uncovering the truth, no matter the cost.  
>  
> Silifrey always had a natural talent for the arcane arts, and loved painting and drawing these ancient symbols. She was elated when Mr. Cotton moved to Roslyndale, as she was able to continue her magical lessons in the absence of her father, as reading from a book is great, but speaking with others with experience is also immensely helpful.  
>  
> Her favorite colors were a cobalt blue and gold.
 
### [Dining Room](#p24)
 
This room was mostly used to host grand feasts and parties. A large pit is in the center of the room with a hefty contraption on top.
 
The Lackmans are hosting a large party when the PCs enter the room, with the hosts on the dais at the back of the room and every seat in the room filled. Laughter and cheer is heard throughout the hall and everyone is euphoric. Looking around, though, reveals that everyone in the room is frozen in time and if any of the guests are inspected, they flicker like a candle in a light breeze. It's at this point the characters realize the laughter sounds distant and ghostly, just like the images of the people. The sounds of glee fade and all that is left is complete silence. Even their footsteps make little noise.
 
In one of the corners can be seen amongst these silent phantoms, a small humanoid shape. Branlyn is here, hiding. Wanting to be a part of the group, but knowing he is too young to join. Yet join he did, against propriety, and against his parents' instruction. When the party approaches him, a hand appears seemingly from the wall, grasps the scruff of his neck, and yanks him into the ethereal plane. Describe this as Branlyn being yanked into the wall.
 
\page  
<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Rescuing Branlyn Lackman](p24)
 
After the party sees Branlyn get kidnapped, the party must enter the ethereal plane in order to save him.
 
Once they find a way in, they must pick up on his trail, not an easy accomphlishment in the realm where no one walks. It was the dybbuks that yanked the child into the ethereal in hopes that they could use him as a pawn to their own ends. Unfortunately, because of their hunger and twisted humor, the outlook doesn't look good for young Branlyn Lackman.
 
> ##### The Ethereal Plane  
> Because of the nature of the ethereal plane, getting to the showdown where the party actually fight the dybbuks for Bran's life was intentionally left abstract. Getting there is a matter of imagination and intention in a way that would be too large for a single chapter.  
>  
> Here are a few things to keep in mind, however:  
>- What does your ethereal plane look like? Mine is basically a dream world where the colors are either exceptionally vivid or extraordinarily muted, with colossal animals, birds, and even fish moving through with ease.  
>- When the party catches up with the dybbuks, they are dangerously close to where the border ethereal meets the deep ethereal. After the fight, decide how easy it is for the party to return to the house. Can they see it with a high enough check? What kind of check would they need to return?  
>- What happens if they wander too far into the deep ethereal (accidently or on purpose)? Maybe there is some kind of denizen that can help them return...for the right price, of course. A Hag, perhaps?
 
#### Entering the Ethereal Plane  
There a few ways into the ethereal plane from here, though the party may need a some guidance to understand this. As mentioned before, the Estate already sits on the border ethereal plane and thusly can be reached if they move through the fog that borders the house. If the party walks to the outside of this room as a result of seeing Branlyn get spirited away, feel free to opt out of reading the viranda scenes.   If during any of the encounters prior to the party enterring the estate, one or more of the [tempus cari](p) passed to the ethereal plane to follow the party instead of fight, a thing that they are likely to do, one or more of them can exit the ethereal plane to help the party through the border, or tell the party how to get through using the fog.
 
#### Saving Branlyn Lackman
 
Once the party enters the ethereal plane, guide them to wear they saw Branlyn get kidnapped. From here, have the party pick up the trail, which leads into the fog wall. When the party catches up, they realize that Branlyn was stolen by a few dybbuks. The showdown happening in the middle of a forest with muted colors.
 
If the party saves Branlyn, when he is summoned by Westra in the end, he will side with the party.
 
#### Failing to Save Branlyn
 
If the party either fails to save Branlyn, or decides it isn't their problem and doesn't go after him, consequences might ensue. If the party doesn't enter the dining room, Branlyn is summoned in the Westra fight with the stats listed.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
 
### [Kitchen](#p24)
 
As soon as the characters walk into the room, read the following box text in the thickest Scottish Brogue you can muster.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
You enter into the kitchen, late again. Chef stands with his back towards you at the center wooden table chopping carrots on a maple wood cutting board. "Well it's about bloody time you lot got here!" He exclaims not turning to you as you enter. You look down and see that you are all wearing cooking clothing, "I've had prepare the damn food alone. If I had anyone else to choose from, you'd not be working here anymore. Get your arses over here and help me!" Unprepared food lines the center and window tables. To your right is a large pot in the grand hearth to the left side and a grate large enough for grilling and pan-cooking to the right.   What do you do?  
</div>
 
This is Chef Gorren Ramski. If the party refuses him, he'll give them one warning, asking them once more to assist them, politely through gritted teeth. If they resist again, he outright attacks them. See the Ramski Fight later in this section. If the party acquiesces, jump to the section titled The Meal.
 
#### The Meal
 
In this particular memory sequence, the characters are playing through cooking for a dinner party hosted by the Lackmans and orchestrated by Chef Gorren Ramski. Everything in the memory has been "rehearsed" many times over to the point where the staff knows exactly when to cook what. To get around the players not having this knowledge, tell them which course they are preparing, referring to the table below, and allow the players to discuss what they want to cook and serve for that course. Whatever the players decide is on the menu is what was rehearsed, with the idea that anything that is prepared has to actually be edible meals.
 
After the players announce their idea for the first course, the Hors D'oeuvres, which should have 3 canapés, declare that this is a skill challenge with 12 checks and have one of the characters take lead on the first check. If the players get stumped on any of the courses, mark off a failure as Chef Ramski scolds them for incompetence before telling them what to make. If the players fail any 3 checks, they fail the skill challenge and Chef Ramski attacks. Jump to the section titled The Fight.
 
When a course is finished, describe spectral staff members enterring the kitchen to retrieve the plates.
 
```  
```
 
##### The Meal

#### The Fight
 
If the players fail the challenge, or outright refuse to "get to work," Chef Gorren Ramski explodes in a fit of rage, doing 4 fire damage to everyone within 10 feet of him, then attacks the nearest character. After the surprise round, choose some or all of the following monsters to join the fight. The stat block for Chef Ramski can be found in the appendices.

### [Servant's Room](#p24)  
**Time Dilation:** Pause the timer
 
This room is placed here as a place of rest. A place where nothing tense happens. This room is for the characters to catch their breath, plan moving forward in a confusing, ever changing village, and possibly gain some insight and information.
 
If the characters get too lost, feel free to have some notes on the desks or books on the shelves explaining a few things from the perspective of the staff. Alternativle, if Mole is with the party, feel free to have him speak up when the party gets too lost, just remember, he only knows what he has researched, nothing more.
 
### [Offices](#p24)
 
The offices are where the managers of the estate staff do their paperwork.
 
#### House Keeper's Office
 
To the right of the pantry is the House Keeper's office where Ms. Buchanon does the paperwork for the estate. Her responsibilities included paying the estate staff, making sure cleaning supplies were stocked and paid for.
 
#### Chef's Office
 
(Put this part in a sidebar near the kitchen fight)
 
In my world, Chef Gorren Ramski was a renowned chef in the kingdom that disapeared one day under mysterious circumstances with the rest of his former adventuring party.
 
Before then, Chef

## [Chamber Floor](#p24)
 
When the party gets to the top of the staircase, the PC that had the initial dream recognizes the hallway in front of them as the hallway from that dream. The difference in this case is that the doors to either side are not locked.
 
Additionally, when the PCs reach the top of the stairs, they hear faint sobbing coming from behind the door at the end of th hallway.
 
### [Westra's Room](#p24)
 
As with the top of the staircase, this is the same room as in the dream. When the PCs enter, the sounds of the sobbing stop, as does the sounds of the storm outside. All sounds are gone and inside this room is completely silent.
 
### [Branlyn's Room](#p24)
 
The youngest of the Lackman children, Branlyn, showed an early fascination with music and instruments and was likely to grow up to be a bard. He and his nanny, Ms. Tetra Withers, spent many long hours in this room. She didn't have the most musical ear, but that didn't matter to young master Branlyn. He loved all the instruments she played for him.
 
One of his most prized possessions was a zoetrope crafted and imbued by his sisters, Kethra and Silifrey Lackman, of a man playing an organ while a sweet tune is played in tandem. The song that is played by the zoetrope can be found in the files of this adventure.
 
### [Kethra's Room](#p24)
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When you enter this room, you see a glowing blue woman in the corner, standing over Kethra, who is frightened and crying from fear. The woman is sobbing sorrowfully with arms outstrecthed as though trying to embrace the young Kethra, who sees you enter the room and cries out for help. This infuriates the woman who then turns to you sharply and hisses angrily at you all.  
Roll Initiative!  
</div>  
Being an artificer, Kethra has created many inventions and her room reflects this. She has a work table with a basic set of tinker's tools. A few items she had created while alive may have survived through to current time. If you decide to create a few items of your own that she's created, remember to keep them simple. She was only a child, afterall. The objects I've created are more mechanically based and include some kind of quirk. I'll list a few below:
 
- A pocket watch that never needs to be wound but if you don't feed it, it dies. The pocket watch can be revived by soaking it in a bowl of blood, at which point, a whirring sound is heard before the watch starts to tick again.  
- A wand with a gemstone on one end that glows whenever magic is near. This includes itself.
 
### [Silifrey's Room](#p24)
 
Silifrey on the other hand is direct student of the arcane, like her father. Her room include a spot to imbue items with magical abilities to further her education into the arcane. Her items, if you decide to create some, are more spell based, and often have some kind of flaw. Examples include:  
- A hat of disguise but when you speak the command word, only the hat is changed.  
- A pair of boots of teleportation but whenever you speak the command word, only the boots teleport.  
- A horn of invisibility that turns you invisible so long as you continue to blow into the horn. The horn can be heard in a 500ft radius.

### [Chapel Upper](#p24)
 
The upper floor of the chapel was used by the Lackman family, themselves. On this floor of the chapel sits uphostered pews overlooking the dais and pulpit. Two more stained glass windows stand from the floor to the ceiling, a bit wider out from eachother than on the first floor. These windows, like the ones downstairs, depict more scenes of Aelus, God of Agriculture.
 
<div class='descriptive'>  
When the party arrive in this area, either by finding a way to ascend from the ground floor or by enterring through the double doors on the chamber floor, they see a middle-aged man and woman, Mr and Mrs Lackman, sitting in the center pew, two young girls, Kethra and Silifrey, sitting on the pew to the left, and a young woman holding an infant boy on the pew to the right. The young woman is Ms Tetra Withers and she is holding young master Branlyn.
 
Kethra turns to party and smiles excitedly and starts to get up before the middle-aged couple shushes her and tells her to sit back down. She reluctantly obliges, but motions to the party to sit next to her and her sister. The party is free to do so, or not.
 
If the party joins her, she begins to bombard them with all sorts of questions ranging from personal questions about the party themselves, to impersonal questions about tinkering and magic. She'll even talk about some of her inventions, musing about things she's excited to create, problems she is stuck on, and things she's proud of having made. The kinds of questions that children often ask when allowed. The questions start off as whispers so as to not interupt the sermon downstairs, but quickly get louder as she becomes more and more excited to have friends to talk to.
 
After a few minutes of this, her sister nudges her to stop talking with her imaginary friends, which she does for only a few seconds before continuing the conversation. After a few more minutes, one of her parents will shush her again. She gives them a forelorn look and her father will look back to her and say kindly and quietly, "it's wonderful to ask questions, but they really should wait until after the service. If you can wait quietly, we'll talk until bedtime, okay Kitty?" Kethra nods and smiles then reaches to hold the hand of the nearest party member. After a moment, the parents, Ms Withers, the sound of the sermon and the vivid colors of the past all fade away and the bodies of the children fade into will-o'-wisps.
 
A few moments later the wisps dance around the room playfully before zapping the PCs. The party is welcome to leave without threat of the Lackman wisps following. Otherwise roll initiative. Something to note, the Lackman wisps were only being playful, so once the party starts to fight back, the wisps turn back into the children and they sulk away. Remember, we are trying to create an emotional attachment to these children.

> ##### Branlyn Lackman  
>  
> Branlyn Lackman was young when we died of the plague that rolled through the village, so his gifts were never known. However, his favorite toys were those that sang a tune or could be used to hold a beat, the musical zoetrope his sisters made being the topmost among them.  
>  
> He loved everything from the hurdy gurdy, a stringed crank box, his father brought home from a trip, to the drums he was gifted by some of the villagers. It was pretty safe to say that had he lived long enough, he was likely to take up the path of troubadour.  
>  
> His favorite colors were bright forest green and bronze.
 
### [Guest Room](#p24)
 
One of the things that made this so risky for Mistress Lackman and Mr. Cotton was that the witchhunter forced the Lackman's to quarter him in the estate
 
When it was time for the Mistress and Mr Cotton to perform the ritual, they had to take care of the head witchhunter quartered in the Lackman Guest Room. On the bed is the body of the head witch hunter who's throat was slit. Knowing they can't take on the head witch hunter head on, the Mistress poisoned him with standard food poisoning so he was forced to take a day off and sleep. This provided the opportunity for her to kill him without him defending himself.
 
In the chest can be found some anti-sorcerer items and weapons. The desk has notes with a couple suspects, one of which was Mr Cotton. The shelves have a couple books detailing some lore from your world from the perspective of the witchhunters and the Sovereign Concordat.
 
> ##### Sorcerers In My Campaign
 
### [Butler's Room](#p24)
 
Mr. James Mallard, the Lackman's butler, held all the secrets of the family close to his chest.
 
A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a vial of poison in the butler's desk. THis is the poison used to murder the head witch hunter.
 
On the bookshelves are reference books ranging from legal books to the best wines and liquors from different regions.
 
### [Wash Room and Water Closet](#p24)  
### [Servant's Quarters](#p24)
 
Everytime a character opens a chest in the servants quarters roll **1dX**. On a 1, the chest is a mimic. For any other number, roll on the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 chart on page DMG136. Any square that has a bed or chest is considered difficult terrain. Note that these are servants quarters, and the servants wouldn't have any other coin denomation above silver pieces. If the treasure roll gives the players 3d6gp, read it as 3d6gp worth of silver and copper.

## [Top Floor, Final Showdown](#p24)
 
> ##### Who is Diven?
 
### Mistress Westra Evelynn Lackman  
### Mr Henry Cotton
 
> ##### Who's on who's side?  
>  
> Westra summons wisps to fight along side her. If the party helped any of the children, this will make it difficult for them to attack the party. If the party helped Kethra (in the cemetery), Silifrey (against the spiders), or Branlyn (from being spirited away), these wisp children will not only stand down from attacking the party, they will even offer boons to help the party, though none of them will attack th eir mother directly.  
>  
> Kethra attacks Mr Cotton, Branlyn offers to tank some of the damage, and Silifrey buffs the characters by giving them a +2 to hit when attacking with weapons and spells.  
>  
> If any of the party attacks with a weapon that isn't magical, the Lackman children enchant one weapon per child to make that weapon magical when being counted towards overcoming resistances and immunities.

## A Secret for the Curious and the Clever
 
The zoetrope and the organ
 
```  
## [Buttery](#p24)
 
The buttery is where all things for drinking go. Flagons, cups, ale, wine, and liquor are all down here. Wine and Liquor, being much more expensive, are separated from the rest behind locked doors, the keys to which were only given to trusted staff. The Lackmans, the butler, and the housekeeper had the only master keys.
 
At night, the staircase is old and rickety. The creature that descends the staircase without inspecting for traps first falls through the staircase and lands prone on the floor taking 1d4 piercing damage as they fall on something sharp. The staircase is low enough for the character to not take additional fall damage.
 
In the center of the Ale and Cheese room is a suit of armor. A plaque on the bottom reads, "[The Penitent Warrior](#p)." The suit of armor activates when someone touches it or reads the poem underneath.

# What Next?
 
So the party defeated the Mistress and her children. What happens now? Well, a few different things could happen, depending on your personal setting, why they came here in the first place, and where you decided to put Roslyndale. This section will describe a few things that might happen next, assuming something comes of this more than whatever treasure they were promised when they took this mission.
 
#### New Owners Of Roslyndale
 
After completing this adventure, the party now comes into ownership of this village of Roslyndale. Maybe the monarch of the area awards them the deeds to the village, maybe this defunked village is very far away from civilization and now the party has a claim to the village.
 
#### The Secrets of Roslyndale
 
Because the village was created by a party whose members included a wizard, Mr. Heward Lackman, there are plenty of things that the party would have missed, and there are many things Mr. Lackman had concealed from the world so they would be forgotten.
 
Whenever the players take a week to investigate the village, have them roll a group investigation check with either their intelligence or wisdom ability.
 
This is less about passing and more about getting a high score. The higher their combined score, the more rare the things they can find. Each thing can be used to start or seed an adventure. Feel free to use any of the magic items from the DMG or your favorite adventure. The following list contains ideas of things you can include
 
- Fraz Urb'luu's, the Demon Lord of Lies, gem under the illusion of the of the church  
- A rare book hidden in the Lackman tower that's a dangerous artifact
