Before the discovery that you can put hops into beer to make it last longer, families would often invite friends over to drink the remainder of their beer before it spoiled. They would also cook older food to feed everyone that came over. Then someone else would host the Public House in their home when their beer was close to spoiling. Over time the name Public House was shortened to Pub.
