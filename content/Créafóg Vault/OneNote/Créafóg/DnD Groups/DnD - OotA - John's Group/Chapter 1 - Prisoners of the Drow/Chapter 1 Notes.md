Spellcasters don't have any spell components or focuses, initially limiting their spellcasting ability. Wizards don't need their spellbooks to cast spells, but will be unable to change their prepared spells without them. Although spellcasting is impossible in the slave pen anyway because of its magical wards.

Each PC has been a prisoner for 1d10 days. (Roll separately for each PC)
 
Any hostile move is met with poisoned crossbow bolts from the drow and possibly a strike from Ilvara's scourge or a ray of sickness spell. The giant spiders attack and poison anyone who attacks the drow. The drow don't kill any of the prisoners (leaving them unconscious at 0 hp) but have no compunction about beating them.

_Drow poison (injury):_  
This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subject to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Con saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If a saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
