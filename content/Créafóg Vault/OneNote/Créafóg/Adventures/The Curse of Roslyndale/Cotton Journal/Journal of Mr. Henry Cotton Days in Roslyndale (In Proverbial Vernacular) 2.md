#### Entry 5: Shifts in the Mistress  
"In recent days, I have noticed a subtle yet unmistakable change in Mistress Lackman's manner towards me. Her conversations are laced with veiled references and probing questions. It has become clear that she knows of my sorcerous lineage, a revelation I fear young Silifrey has innocently divulged. The implications of this realization are deeply troubling, and the burden of this shared secret weighs heavily upon us."
 
#### Entry 6: The Mistress's Request  
"In the wake of our shared grief, the Mistress approached me with a query most gentle yet laden with hope. She inquired if I might delve into the realm of resurrection â€“ a subject theoretical at best. Her eyes, though sorrowful, held a glimmer of hope, a beacon in her sea of despair."
 
#### Entry 7: Experiments in Resurrection  
"My days and nights are now consumed by the study of resurrection. Experimentation on departed beasts of the field hath yielded promising results. The prototype ritual, a delicate balance of life and death, hath breathed a semblance of life into lifeless forms. Yet, this success on creatures of lesser complexity provides no certainty for its efficacy on human souls."
 
#### Entry 8: A Glimmer of Hope  
"The success of my experiments on animal corpses has sparked a flicker of hope. Though the prototype ritual is successful in these lesser trials, it remains unproven in its potential to resurrect human life. The leap from beast to man is vast and fraught with uncertainty."
 
#### Entry 9: The Mistress's Growing Impatience  
"As days turn to weeks, the Mistress's demeanor shifts from gentle inquiry to a more pressing urgency. Her requests for progress in the research of resurrection grow more fervent. The weight of expectation and the gravity of the task at hand weigh heavily upon me."
 
#### Entry 10: Under Duress  
"The Mistress, now wielding my secret as a weapon, compels me to hasten my work. Her patience thins like the waning moon, and her once kind demeanor is overshadowed by a growing desperation. I find myself cornered, forced to tread a path fraught with danger."
