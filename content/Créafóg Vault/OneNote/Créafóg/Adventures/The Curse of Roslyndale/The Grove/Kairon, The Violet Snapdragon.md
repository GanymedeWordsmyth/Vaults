The ghost who contacts the players:  
A fiendish ghost approaches the party. Two pairs of segmented horns and long, wavy hair, pulled back into a low ponytail sprout from the figure's head. The front pair splits near the base and wrap around each other and fuse at the end, while the other come out of the figure's temples and curl around his ears ending in what looks to be sculpted arrowheads that point forward and slightly down. His face is sharp with a pointed chin, very high cheekbones, and a long, powerful nose. He is wearing a high-collared, light-weighted jacket with a belt strap across his chest that is adorned with pouches and a slingshot and fastened to his belt is a rapier as long and slender as his smooth, whipped tail that curls around his body as he walks towards you, the end of which is forked and flared. Along his back can be seen a violin and violin bow.  
The figure takes a long drag from the thick cigar held in his jagged teeth as he walks towards the group. When he gets within comfortable talking distance, he removes it with his thumb and first two fingers and speaks to the party. Very quickly you realize you can't hear anything he says. After a few moments of failing to communicate with you, he slowly reaches towards one of your foreheads, but waits as though asking for consent.  
(If any of the party obliges, read the Roslyndale dreams section.)  
Statue in the center of the village square:  
In the center of the village strands a tall statue with wide shoulders and fit, handsome features. From the figure's head sprouts 2 pairs of segmented horns and long, wavy hair pulled back in a low ponytail. The front two come out of the front of the figure's forehead and split near the base, twisting around each other as they curl backwards over the figure's head and fuse into one horn where they end. The second, smaller pair come out of the figure's temples and curl around the ears, ending in what looks to be sculpted arrowheads that point downwards and a little forwards. The figure's face is sharp with a pointed chin, very high cheek bones, and a long, powerful nose. He is holding a thick cigar in his jagged, pointed teeth. The figure is portrayed with a high-collared, light-weight jacket with a belt strap across the chest with items and pouches attached to it. One of those items is a slingshot. At his side is a sheathed rapier as long and slender as his smooth, whipped tail that curls around his body and forks at the end. His hands are clothed with fingerless gloves and he stands in an upright posture playing a violin.
