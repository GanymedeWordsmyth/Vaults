Gravekeeper's Lantern can be found here
 
In the eastern part of the graveyard, a skeleton can be seen rummaging through the grass, lifting stones, and digging shallowly looking for its other shoe. If it notices the party, it will wave them down and attempt to ask for help. If approached by the party, the skeleton will look down at Allanon's feet and make grabby hands. A successful perception check reveals that he only has on one shoe. In a pocket, if killed, is a [coin of delving](https://5e.tools/items.html#coin%20of%20delving_egw) (EGW)
 
A young girl (Silifrey) can be heard crying out front of the statue. When approached by the party, she straightens up and takes a regal stance. Wiping away her tears, she apologizes for making such a show of her emotions, as a Lady often does when her veneer drops.  
When the party asks what is the matter, she responds, "There are monsters in my house. I've tried talking to them, and I've tried fighting them. But they don't answer me. I don't know what they are doing here."
 
When the party enters, one of the zeitgeists hold up a hideous lantern with faces twisted in agony towards them. After a second, it looks at the lantern and shakes it, then holds it back up to the party. Roll initiative. On its first turn, the spirit puts the lantern on its belt.
 
After defeating the Zeitgeists, Silifrey will thank the party and give them her pair of boots of planting that her sister made for her. When she goes into her tomb, Kethra jumps out to scare her, "Kitty what are you doing in my bed again?"  
"Those monsters scared me so I came to find you" an infant's cry can be heard from another tomb  
"Kitty! You woke Branlyn" she walks over to the tomb with the crying infant and picks up what looks like the ghost of a 2 year old boy "sorry Frey," says Kitty looking down apologetically.  
"There, there bean, your sisters have you. These nice people scared off the monsters," Frey responds as they slowly fade from sight.

After leaving the mausoleum, a woman approaches the group, distraught. When she draws near, the party can see through her visage. She tells the party the something scary is happening at the manor house.

- This is one of the house maidens, specifically one of the scullery maids. She was working towards a promotion and pay raise before everything went down.
- She saw Mr Cotton arrive on time then after a moment, strange lights and sounds started to occur and she ran away in fright.
- She knows that the Mistress and Mr Cotton were working towards something, not sleeping together as others have suggested. But she does not know the nature of their goal.
