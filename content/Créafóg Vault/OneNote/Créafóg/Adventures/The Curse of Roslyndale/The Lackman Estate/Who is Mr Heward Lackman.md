~~Priest of Aelus, God of agriculture~~
 
Heward Lackman, human
 
Very high level wizard obsessed with the World of the Ancients. Before magic changed.
 
Mr Lackman had a very strong lead as to the whereabouts Diven's Rest.  
Note: he was unable to find the location of Diven's Rest, but he knows as much as anyone can know what it is and has noted three possible locations.  
~~Mr Lackman has gone to one of these locations to find Diven's Rest, but was unable to gaze upon its splendor and madness set in. No longer knowing himself, he became bound to the location, unable to leave.~~
