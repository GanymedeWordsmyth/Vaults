Encounter 1: Wererats  
As you wake, while you're having first meal/doing your first wake ritual, Jimjar comes to and says he needs to talk you all in private. He tells that he's been hearing skittering noises following the party since and last night he heard a horrible howling noise. "I have a grave feeling about what is to come." he exclaims. No betting, no wagers. Just flat out talking.

Encounter 2: Both: Shelter feat. Gelatinous Cube  
After eight hours of travel (movement, foraging, etc.) you eventually come to a large hovel. The hovel looks as though it could be easily guarded from all angles. Inside this hovel, you can see a skeleton facing the corner of the room away from you. Its clothes are tattered and mostly rotted away. It wields a mostly corroded shortsword and targe. Surrounding this skeleton floats three vials with red liquid inside them (Healing Potions), a small mirror set in a painted wooden frame, and a small silver raven statuette.  
Check to see if anyone has a pP of at least 15.  
After the encounter plays out, those who are looking around will find an old bookcase amongst other furniture. Upon inspection, one may find that there is a lighter color of dust surrounding one book in particular. Pulling on this book will open a secret door to a very large room that will comfortably fit everyone while they rest.
