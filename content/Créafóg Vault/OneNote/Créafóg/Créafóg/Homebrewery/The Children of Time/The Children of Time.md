The liberi temporis, or children of time, are a civilization loosely based off the Roman Republic during the time when Latin was the dominant language. Thought to have perished long ago, these liberi were watchers over time, healing any temporal rifts they came across. In truth, they are so closely linked with time, their society and their cities slowly phased from the Prime Material Plane into the Ethereal Plane, where they now reside.
 
Spending so long on this plane, they are no longer humanoids, even though they still take this form. Now they are elementals of the ethereal plane.
 
Liberi temporis that complete rigorous training become the tempus cari, or time menders.  
Tempus cari seen on the Prime Material Plane are simply trying to mend the broken temporal rift that brought them here. As such they will not attack now interact with anyone unless provoked or prevented in some way from completing their task. Tempus cari seen on the Prime Material Plane are often referred to by learned people as zeitgeists. Commoners call them shades, wraiths, or shadows. Tempus cari are fiercely loyal to one another. Woe be unto those who take full measures to properly end the life of one.
 
Bred for war, the tutelae, or security, are the front line attack group for the liberi temporis  
(Liberi temporis that are more suited to combat become the tutelae, or security)  
When time becomes broken in an area, many creatures, such as the dybbuks, seize the opportunity to rip the hole further and further open. The tutelae are sent ahead to clear the way for the tempus cari and make areas safe to work in. Each tutela is a fierce killing machine, not too intelligent, but they certainly get the job done.
 
The concept that the Children of Time, or "Liberi Temporis," suffered a collective soul sundering due to their hubris adds a rich, tragic layer to their backstory and provides a cautionary tale within your campaign. This event could explain their current existence in the Ethereal Plane, their transformation into beings of ethereal essence, and the remnants of their once-great civilization that players might encounter. Here’s how this narrative element can be woven into the fabric of your campaign:
 
### The Fall of the Liberi Temporis  
- **Catastrophic Event**: The collective soul sundering of the Liberi Temporis could have been the result of a grand experiment or a ritual aimed at mastering time itself, which went catastrophically wrong. Their ambition to wield ultimate control over time led to an irreversible fracture in their society's soul, phasing their entire civilization into the Ethereal Plane.   - **Ethereal Existence**: Now existing as ethereal beings, the Liberi Temporis might possess only fragmented memories of their past glory and the mistake that led to their downfall. Their current actions, whether as guardians of time or isolated ethereal entities, are driven by a deep-seated desire to mend the fabric of time they once tore asunder, perhaps as a form of penance.
 
### Implications for the Campaign  
- **Mystery and Exploration**: Discovering the true history of the Liberi Temporis and the nature of their fall could be a significant questline. Players can uncover ancient ruins, lost texts, and ethereal echoes that reveal the story piece by piece.   - **Moral Lessons**: The fate of the Liberi Temporis serves as a powerful lesson on the dangers of hubris and the limits of power. Characters dabbling in soul magic or temporal manipulations can draw parallels to their own potential fates, adding weight to their choices.   - **Redemption Arc**: There may still be Liberi Temporis who seek to fully atone for their society's errors and find a way to restore their souls. Players could ally with these beings, embarking on quests to heal the wounds in the fabric of time and perhaps, in the process, find ways to prevent their own Psi from reaching catastrophic levels.   - **Antagonists or Complicated Allies**: Some of the Liberi Temporis might have been twisted by their transformation, becoming antagonists who seek to manipulate time for their own ends or to draw others into their ethereal existence. Conversely, others might serve as mentors or allies, offering guidance on navigating the dangers of soul magic and the Ethereal Plane.
 
Integrating the tragic history of the Liberi Temporis into your campaign not only enriches the world's lore but also introduces complex themes of ambition, consequence, and redemption. It provides a backdrop against which players can measure their own exploration of soul magic and temporal powers, offering both warnings and wisdom from a civilization that reached too far, too fast.
 
The concept that the Children of Time—due to their hubris—suffered a collective soul sundering, leading to their society's shift into the Ethereal Plane, offers a compelling and richly thematic backstory for your setting. This narrative not only deepens the lore of your world but also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of delving too deeply into the mysteries of soul magic and time manipulation. Here’s how this idea could be further developed and integrated into your campaign:
 
### The Fall of the Children of Time  
- **Cataclysmic Event**: The collective soul sundering could have been the result of a singular, ambitious attempt by the Children of Time to achieve a monumental feat—perhaps trying to rewrite a major historical event, attain immortality, or gain ultimate control over the fabric of time itself. Their hubris led to a catastrophic miscalculation, causing a backlash that fractured their collective souls.
 
- **Shift to the Ethereal Plane**: The aftermath of this event didn't just sunder their souls but also caused their entire civilization—cities, people, and culture—to phase out of the Material Plane and into the Ethereal Plane. This shift might have been a protective measure gone awry or a direct consequence of their souls' fragmentation, binding them to the Ethereal Plane.
 
- **Transformation into Ethereal Beings**: Over time, the Children of Time adapted to their new existence on the Ethereal Plane, their forms and essences becoming intertwined with ethereal energy. This transformation allowed them to survive and even thrive in their new state, but at the cost of losing much of their humanity and connection to the Material Plane.
 
### Societal Implications  
- **Lost Knowledge and Legacy**: The fall of the Children of Time left behind ruins, artifacts, and enigmatic lore scattered across the Material Plane, ripe for discovery by adventurers. These remnants offer glimpses into their advanced understanding of soul magic and time manipulation, serving as both warnings and temptations.
 
- **Ethereal Guardians and Watchers**: Some of the Children of Time, particularly the Tempus Cari and Tutelae, continue their original mission to mend temporal rifts and protect against threats from beyond time. However, their actions and motives are now influenced by their transformed nature and the tragic history of their civilization.
 
- **Quests and Campaign Arcs**: The story of the Children of Time can inspire quests to uncover the truth about their fate, seek their lost knowledge, or even attempt to heal the scars left by their collective sundering. Characters might interact with ethereal remnants of this civilization, negotiate with their guardians, or face threats unleashed by their fall.
 
### Narrative Themes  
- **Hubris and Redemption**: The tale of the Children of Time serves as a narrative about the dangers of hubris and the pursuit of forbidden knowledge. It also opens the door for themes of redemption, as characters might seek to repair the damage done by the Children of Time or prevent a similar fate from befalling their own civilization.
 
- **The Cost of Power**: This backstory emphasizes the cost of wielding great power, particularly when it comes to manipulating the very essence of life and the fabric of reality. It serves as a cautionary backdrop against which your players' adventures unfold, highlighting the importance of wisdom, restraint, and respect for the unknown.
 
Incorporating the fate of the Children of Time as a foundational element of your campaign's lore enriches the world with depth, mystery, and a sense of historical continuity. It sets the stage for a narrative that intertwines the personal with the cosmic, inviting players to explore the profound implications of their actions in a universe where the past is both a guide and a warning.
