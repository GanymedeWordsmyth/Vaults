Catacombs of the Vawdrey Knights:
 
The Vawdrey Knights were the protectors of the Callobre Forest. The catacombs were created to honor the fallen knights who died a warrior's death defending the forest. Those buried here are done so with the weapon they carried in life.
 
Morys Vawdrey, druid master, trained Fearthainne Solasta in the ancient ways of the forest. Morys was slain while fighting the ettercaps and the horde of giant creatures. His body was recovered and laid to rest in the Catacombs.
 
An offering bowl and chalice, a candelabra, and a burial ritual inscribed on a scroll lay on the alter to honor the dead. Beside the altar sit two large braziers containing an eternal flame. The tools and ingredients for the ritual are stored in the locked cupboard.
 
The Vawdrey treasure is only given in times of strife when the fate of the forest is at risk.
 
The heroes have to go to Fearthainne or Maltir to immediately figure out the full extent of the Bogthorn weapons?
 
6 suits of armor line the entrance of the catacombs, representing the protectors of the catacombs. Some of them are decayed, while others look weathered but still wearable. By completing the ritual but not passing the test, the Vawdrey ghost will animate 2 or 3 of the suits (use the Animated Armor stat block in the MM) and they will attack the summoner and his/her allies as they attempt to exit.
