History:  
After the fall of Netheril, the surviving followers of Amaunator forsook him assuming he did nothing to prevent the demise of their great city. The sudden lack of worshippers forced Amaunator into a dormant state. Seeing this weakness, Demogorgon took it upon himself to drag one of Amaunator's mighty temples deep into the heart of the Abyss. The other gods saw this abomination and banned together to curse the hideous Demogorgon to an eternal slumber.
 
Box text:  
Eventually you see the walls close in ahead of you and from that narrow hallway flows out a very bright light. Daeg immediately recognizes the light as very similar to the light from the sun. Unfortunately, there is no clear path around this what looks to a be a winding hallway. **[run a Tight Passage encounter]** As you row through the tight passage, it quickly expands into a large, hollow cavern. In the middle of this cavern sits a large plot of land protruding from the water with what looks like the remnants of dead grass and bushes, the petrified remains of a mighty tree and what seems like from a distance a perfectly preserved temple from which the sunlight seems to be originating. The front part of this plot is very close to the water's surface and it looks like you can moor the boat and climb up to it with ease. As you approach this plot, Daeg's spider springs out of its hiding spot and excitedly sits on his shoulders. It spins a few time, and quickly runs from one shoulder to the other and back.
 
A hag poofs into view in a white cloud when you enter the cavern. "He's come. He's come!! Not many find this place. Not many? bah, not any! Not since the Maven found it. Hello! Hello travelers!! Maven Delve am I. Daegastor, Ivar, Dranu and Fin you. Wait…Nooo, Ivar prefers Belbol…No, Belbol prefers Ivar. A mystery. A mystery. Oh how I love mysteries. Escaped from the pit you have and to the surface you are going. Shush no stop talking shut up and let them talk. Do not introduce those who are new to yourself before they do. It's rude!!" Hemeth cuts her off to try and question her, but she cuts him off saying, "Sacrifices made, sacrifice escaped. The prince is mad, the Prince! He's upset. He's coming, he's coming!! He's coming for you." **[said terribly]**
 
And with that she looks to you trying to hold herself back from speaking more in an attempt to give you a turn to talk. When each tries to talk, she say:
 
Daeg:  
An angel, no a sun man. A Sunmaster? Oh lovely! He's come to reclaim the Sun. **[said very gleefully]**
 
Belbol:  
A bite. a hidden bite, the turn most inviting. And a beast that shows him the way. **[said woefully]**
 
Dranu:  
Letters, secret letters, a magic parchment from an unknown pen. Who is it? Who is it? Who is the one in trouble that writes these letters? **[said mysteriously]**
 
Fin:  
Ooh then there's you. A death, a spidery death, a false death. Liar…thief…spy!! And good you are on the battlefield. **[said mockingly]**
 
Eldeth:  
Your king, her king. Back to her king. Be careful on your journey or your king you'll never see. **[said sadly]**
 
Jimjar:  
I bet your fate is known, Jimjar. Wanna play? Known by me, Jimjar!! Oh do play. Jimjar, Jimjar, loves the gamble, gamble he can not resist the gamble!! **[said playfully as a child who teases another]**  
To which Jimjar replies, "You witch are lucky that I'm too sick to play. Else I'd win."
 
Eldeth volunteers to stay behind with Jimjar to make sure he's okay and to give him medicines. Hemeth says he should also stay behind to guard the other two should anything happen while the group is gone, especially with "the witch" so near. [But he doesn’t push it if the PCs insist he come. In this case he'll get distracted by the architecture.]
 
Upon walking up to ruins of this once great temple, you feel yourselves walk through a sort of force field. You can see a ripple originating from you move and wriggle around what seems like a large bubble surrounding the ruins like a pebble in a stream. As you step through this invisible wall, you all hear the faint sounds of fighting and war horns from within your minds (play [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju_bCrY0nX4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju_bCrY0nX4)). Then the noise fades away (after a few seconds, slowly turn the volume back down again and stop the video).
 
As you enter the temple, you can look around to see beautiful architecture. **{If the PCs insisted on Hemeth coming with them, read the following: As you move through into the nave, Hemeth gets distracted by the foreign architecture. [Any attempt to get there attention results in them saying that it looks pretty safe so they stay there to observe the cathedral as they haven't seen this before. If pressed they'll add that they can come in to flank anyone if there's any trouble.]}** A large bell metal has fallen from the spire on the left and now sits near the entrance. Within this Cathedral stands many ornate stained glass panels. Some of these panels have been completely shattered and now are chaotically strewn across the floor. A few pillars have also crumbled onto the floor, but the building seems pretty stable without them. On each the pillars sits one large tarnished golden dome with twelve tarnished gold spikes protruding from the edges of the dome. **[show the Amaunator sign below]** In the nave (where the pews would be) there are what look like statues of human men and women sitting cross legged with their palms facing skyward and are bent over with their heads by there feet. The very same position that you have seen Daeg assume throughout this journey. These statues are all facing towards the ambulatory. **[DC 8 investigation, medicine, etc.]** Upon further inspection, you will notice that these are actually not statues, but really are the petrified remains of the congregation.
 
As you approach the far side of the ambulatory, you look up to see an apse depicting a man with a brilliant white mask sat cross legged with his palms facing the sky meditating. He is bare chested and displayed on either side of him are a chain shirt and buckler which are adorned with sunburst motifs and long scraggly hair frames the man's masked face. A brilliant long sword is depicted below the man.
 
Below the apse, dominating the center of a large stone relief is a portrait of a large beast with two roaring baboon heads. Suckered tentacles sprout from the shoulders of a great apelike torso outwards spanning the length of the relief. Below this beast is a man facing it poised in a fighters stance with a brilliant sword, long and straight with small lines protruding from the blade depicting its brilliance. Appearing out from beneath the tentacles can be seen other large beasts attacking and terrorizing small towns. Battles with the various demon lords can be seen throughout the relief.
 
On the floor beneath the apse and relief stands a pedestal with five candle sconces sitting around where a book would have been put. The pedestal is short with a kneeler underneath it. **[DC 5]** On the underside of the pedestal is a small button. **[Run the flashback encounter]**
 
The mask is the brilliant white adorned with four resplendently xanthous stones expertly shaped like illustrious stars shimmering in the candlelight.

Flash Back Encounter:
 
When you push the button in the panel, a shockwave blasts through the group. All of you wake up dazed and confused. You look around and give each other a nod checking if you are all okay. You notice that you're back on the surface in the middle of a large battle. It must be sometime in the middle of the night as it is almost pitch black outside. _What a strange dream,_ you think to yourselves as you ready yourselves to return to the battle, your mind still on your "underworld adventures." You remember pain of that club that came from nowhere that was used to knock you out. You check yourselves trying to remind yourselves who you are, _that dream felt like an entire lifetime_. Then you grasp at your holy symbol and let out a sigh of relief as you see the bright, shining sun pendant is right in the place you left it.
 
From behind, you hear a low growl and you turn around to see **[describe balor general]** flying behind you. He raises his arms and wings and flies into the air as he let's out a great and terrible roar as **[describe manes and hellhounds]** rise out the ground as the demon flies to its next target. Roll initiative.
 
Run the first encounter
 
Suddenly, in the heat of battle, you suddenly hear the alarm horn sound retreat [make horn sound]. As you make your way back to the temple, a ragged, old woman steps in front of you. She looks at you and smiles as she transforms **[describe Nighthag]** She points a nasty, deranged finger towards you as a dimensional doorway appears and two **massive black beasts with many tails step out of the portal [displacer beasts]**, letting out a low and feral grumble. "Kill them," she proclaims with her old, wicked voice. She then steps away into the darkness, laughing manically as the beasts step forward to face you.
 
Run the Second encounter
 
You are able to make it back to the temple safely. When you enter, you see Abbot Wyatt Ferris, the priest of Amaunator, standing at the altar performing his Hallowing of Daylight (PHB 249). After completing his ritual, light as bright as the sun emanates fills the area and any of the fiends that were inside the temple burn to ash. You can hear the fiends outside this area banging on the force shield as they try to force their way in…"We must protect the mask!!" You hear the Abbot yell over the commotion…The banging slowly fades as the fiends retreat under the ground. There is an uneasy silence in the air as everyone stands poised for whatever is next. The Abbot quickly beacons to you four to come with him and heads over to the mask to put it in it's resting place for protection. He then presses a button and a small door slides open revealing a small hole. A box shaped with excellent craftsmanship pops out of the hole and the Abbot takes it out and opens it. He takes out from his robes a beautifully carved ivory mask with four shimmering gemstone, shining bright like a four midnight stars, pure and white. He gently sets the mask inside the satin lined and cushioned interior. As he makes to put it back, a tentacle crashes through the window and grabs the man by a foot. As he is whisked away, he drops the box and it hits the floor with a *thud* as he cries out "protect the mask!!!" before disappearing through the broken window. **Wait for the PCs to put the box in the hole.** When the box is pushed in, a small *click* is heard. The door then slides in front of the hole creating a seamless façade. The silence was short lived as the ground beneath the temple begins to quake. You look out a window to find a fissure spreading with inhuman speed in a perfect shape around the Hallowed ground. "DEMOGORGON!!" you hear someone shout as four long tentacles protrude out from around the now completed fissure. The tentacles rise up and curl around the force shield. _Why has Amaunator forsaken us,_ you think to yourselves as the tentacles pull the temple under the ground revealing a hideously monstrous beast with two heads. (? _I am truly sorry my children_, you hear a godly voice say within your heads and? ) in an instant the beast drags the temple deep, deep down into the hellish underworld.
 
The temple crashes into the underdark where it and your bodies now lay, unconscious from the original blast wave. You wake up, and brush the dust and debris off of yourselves.
 
Puzzle for the mask:

1. A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check shows the observer that the mask is actually a small, thumb sized button
2. A small box is clunks and is pushed out from the bottom.
3. Upon taking the box, the observer sees ancient glyphs depicting a pledge. Placing your hand on the box and reciting the pledge opens the box revealing
4. Speaking the answer in the ancient language (Tadriel) opens the box.
