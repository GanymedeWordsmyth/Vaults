When crafting a sorcerer, the player chooses one of [[The Endless]]. The one they choose need not be of the list. [[The Endless]] are basically concepts of humanity; love, happiness, death, despair. After choosing one of [[The Endless]], the player chooses the theme of power their sorcerer would have and how that would manifest.

Sorcerers in [[Baile]] are hunted by witch hunters
Slurs
	Hagborn, Wormeater, Plague'd One, Harbinger, Witch, Witchborn
Madness
	Utilizing magic causes madness. If a leveled spell was cast, the sorcerer must make a saving throw at the beginning of the next long rest or increase their psi. The DC equals 5 plus the total levels cast between the end of the previous long rest and the current long rest
	Additionally, any sorcerer that goes a full day without casting a leveled spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, roll a d3
		1 - on a failed save, the sorcerer suffers one point of exhaustion. This point of exhaustion doesn't decrease until the following long rest.
		2 - Sometime in the middle of the night, raw magic bursts forth from the sorcerer in an unpredictable way. DM rolls on the wild magic table.
		3 - nothing happens

	Regrowing body parts in this manner leaves scars
	Implications:

Origins:
	During the Saoirse, many of those defending the humans came up with a way to enhance the human's innate understanding of the weave to create the first sorcerers. These were weapons of war during a time where the humans were losing, badly. This turned the tide of the entire war and paved the way for the humans to win their independence.
	After the war finally ended, it was observed that enhancing these abilities, drew the sorcerer mad and without an enemy to focus this madness, the madness then turned towards whoever was closest. In this case, Baile.
	In an effort to not lose the product of all their hard work to the very weapon they created in the first place, the humans trained individuals to hunt down and exterminate these sorcerous individuals. These individuals called themselves the [[Vawdrey Knights]]. 
	After the final sorcerer was exterminated, the humans rested easy. At least, until they realized that life is rarely so simple. It turns out that once that door opened, it could no longer be closed. It turns out that the method used to create sorcerers change the way the weave works entirely. Now, whenever an expecting mother crosses certain areas of the weave, the weave seeps into the womb and infuses with the unborn child and thus a sorcerer is created. 
	Unfortunately, this infusion is impossible to detect until the abilities of the child start to manifest, even to the child themself.
