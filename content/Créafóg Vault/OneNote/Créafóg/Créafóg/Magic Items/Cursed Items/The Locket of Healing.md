Once a day whenever you open this locket, it heals you and your party to full health. The portrait within the locket changes everyday.
 
DM note: the portrait within the locket changes daily and is only revealed when the locket is opened. The portrait is always of a living person that is currently on the same plane of existence as the locket. The locket heals the party by stealing the life force from the person whos portrait is in the locket that day, dealing damage to that person equal to the hit points healed, ~~even if the amount healed is greater than the amount that person has.~~ Update - 3Jan24: If the locket is to heal the party for more health than any individual has to give, the locket instead shows a portrait of however many people it takes to bring the party to max.
