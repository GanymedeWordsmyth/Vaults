# Druid Circle of the Oracle  
As nature's oracle, you have the means to gain access to lost and forgotten information and thoughts, floating through the air like fine strands of a spider's silk no longer anchored. You seem to be the only one to see these strands of thought. The only one to be able to interact with and absorb them.
 
These druids often find it difficult to connect with others, as they are too easily distracted by what they are thinking.  
##### Circle of the Oracle Features  
| Druid Level | Feature |  
|:----:|:-------------|  
| 2nd | *Circle Spells, Eyes of the Oracle, Awakened Thoughts* |  
| 6th | *Eyes of the Oracle (Improved), Inception* |  
| 10th | *Mentalist* |  
| 14th | *Iron Mind* |
    
#### Circle Spells  
Your connection with nature has allowed you to gain knowledge and insight that others wouldn't normally have. At 2nd level, you can see forgotten and lost trains of thought. You learn the *encode thoughts* cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Oracle Spells table.
 
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Eyes of the Oracle  
Starting at 2nd level, you can spend an action to heighten your sense of sight and search your surroundings for thin wisps of fine spider silk of lost and forgotten thoughts within 30ft for 10 minutes. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.
 
At 6th level, you can use the *encode thoughts* cantrip to gain more insight into any thought you absorb. While Eyes of the Oracle is active, you can see a creature's entire train of thought and the physical situation they were in when they had it (example: what they were hearing, seeing, and doing). This ability also gives you the direction and distance from you of the creature who's memory you absorbed as long as you are on the same plane of existence. If the creature is on another plane of existence, this ability will tell you on which plane that creature is.
 
#### Awakened Thoughts  
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic to your heightened senses. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and gain the following benefits.  
- Telepathy 120ft  
- Your ability to see into the minds of others allows you to know how they will behave in combat giving them disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throw against you and your spells and grants you advantage on attack rolls and saving throws against them and their spells.
 
These benefits last for 10 minutes, or until you use your Wild Shape again.
 
#### Inception  
At 6th, can plant thoughts into an unwilling creature and that creature will think of that thought as though they thought it themselves. The creature must make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours. On a fail, the creature believes that the thought originated within the creature. Creatures with an intelligence of 3 or less are immune to this effect. Creatures that are unconscious, or are a target of the detect thoughts spell, make the saving throw with disadvantage.
 
#### Mentalist  
At 10th level, your mastery over the mental realm allows you to expand your mind and manipulate those around you to a small degree. Once per turn, you can use a bonus action to cast *sanctuary* with a range of self. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest
 
#### Iron Mind  
At 14th level, you're ability to see into the minds of others hardens your own mind. You gain blindsight out to 30 feet and are immune to being charmed and frightened. Additionally, with Eyes of the Oracle active, you know whenever someone is lying to you.
