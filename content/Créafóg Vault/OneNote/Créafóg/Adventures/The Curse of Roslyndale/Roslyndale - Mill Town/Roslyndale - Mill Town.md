~~Based off cardinal sins~~
 
**Need to reorganize the Roslyndale pages**  
**Create a few maps for a couple different businesses**  
**What is the plague that went around?**  
**Aging effects?**
 
~~Total ghost town or turning into one~~  
~~Mother and daughter turned into wispmothers~~  
~~Townsfolk turned into wisps~~  
Thick fog falls on the town at night  
Arrive in the afternoon  
During the day it looks a little poor and run down, but still a living town. Although the people they meet sound off. For human characters, there is a faint smell of ozone in the air. Those they meet speak almost as if their speech is scripted and the script doesn't quite line up. To get across this effect, whenever the part asks a question, answer a question that is similar but not quite the one that was asked. The people ignore any requests to repeat themselves.  
At night, a heavy fog sets in. **[Start the Uneasy playlist]** Any living person sleeping is awoken by something they can't quite place. As they look around, what they see is not what was seen just a few hours ago. Everything is decrepit and in complete disarray. When they check in on their host/innkeeper, no one will be there.
 
**In the distance you see buildings standing. Looking down at your map, you've finally arrived at you destination. The sun is just cresting its highest point in the sky. As you approach the town give me a perception check (DC 13). Those that pass notice the buildings look a little run down and could use some love and attention. As you continue to get closer the rest of you start to see this as well. Once you arrive in the town, Allanon and Cleethus, you smell a very faint smell of ozone inthe air.**
 
During the day, the party will meet Mistress Lackman at the counter of the first shop they go to.  
**You see at the counter finishing her business with the shopkeeper a woman wearing a very well finely crafted black, floor length dress, and black elbow length gloves. Her ellegant lace veil is so thin it almost looks like it was made from spider's silk. She nods to you all as she exits,** "It's nice to see some new faces around here," **you can hear tears in her eyes as vshe speaks.** "Fareweather Mr. Marlboro," **she says to the man behind the counter.** "Fareweather Mistress Lackman," **he responds.** "Poor lady, lost all three of her dearest not long ago to the plague. Well anyways, my apologese for such a dreary introduction to the town. My name is Mr. Marlboro and this here is my shop. How may I be of assistance to you?"
 
Who was the Wispmother in life? What happened to her child?  
The Wispmother used to be the patron/landlady of Roslyndale. Her children fell ill to a fatal disease. The Final battle takes place in her manor house in which lie numerous [Residual Hauntings](https://www.spelltheory.online/residual-hauntings/).  
Bailens are based off Faerun's Illuskans  
Name in life was **Westra Lackman**.  
Children who died were **Bran (M), Silifrey (F), and Kethra (F)**  
The Lackman family graves can be found in the graveyard.
 
Make Roslyndale shop maps:  
Inn and Tavern  
Mill  
Bakery  
Market area (this will act as the "general store," almost anything in the PHB can be bought or sold here*)  
Church/Graveyard (Boss fight? No, this will have clues as to what happened and where to find the Wispmother)  
Blacksmith?
 
***Anything bought within Roslyndale will become decrepit and unusable. The money spent will be on the stand where they bought the item. Anything sold in Roslyndale will can be found on the counter where they left it and money will vanish during rest.**
 
Work on what's in the graveyard
 
**The Following notes only happen during the night. While in daylight, the town operates as any normal town.**  
**Side note: During the day Mistress Lackman spends the time in her room mourning the loss of her children.**
 
**Nights spent within Roslyndale are filled with unsettling dreams. Characters need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom save to benefit from a long rest**
 
House 1:  
Hunger Ghost on the main floor (DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be aged 1d4 x 10 years)  
Stairs are old and will break under pressure causing 1d6 fall damage to anyone on the staircase  
Corpse of a Man and a woman in the bed upstairs and an infant in a bassinette.  
**Describe their leathery skin and the fabric and bed as being old, decrepit, and brittle.**  
A Wisp rises from the bassinette  
**You also see next to the bed a hooded bassinette with a skirt designed to obscure what's inside. As you approach you see a leathery doll lying within the bassinette**  
If the party approaches the child, two shadows rise from the bodies of the parents. After the fight with the shadows, a Wisp  
**As you approach the child, give me a perception check (DC 12). Those that pass notice that the bodies on the bed no longer have a shadow.**  
**After the fight with the shadows, the child's body begins to glow.**  
**A small blue flame ascends from the leathery corpse. What do you do?**  
The goal of the wisp is not to fight. It is merely curious about the party but will ultimately leave if unprovoked. If provoked, it will shock one of the players, then use it's movement to flee. If the party follows, it will turn invisible.  
**The Blue flame moves out the window towards another house. After a few minutes it disappears into that house**  
House 2:  
A little more wealthy overall.  
What's in the foot chest?  
What's in the lockbox?  
Roll on the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 chart (DMG136)  
Key with a symbol on it **goes to the church**
 
House 3:  
Mr Cotton's house, the wizard that was conscripted to help raise the children back from the dead. The spell went horribly wrong and rose the children's souls as Will-o-Wisps instead and turned the Mistress into a Wispmother. It also froze the town in its current state, though when the sun sets, Aide and Minuris reveal the truth.  
Low-level wizard. Lived cheaply. There's a destroyed book case in the office room and some notes and journals on the desk. Passing a DC 12 Investigation reveals a hidden drawer with a spell book concealed within it.  
What is in the journal? What can it be used to learn?
 
Manor House  
The manor house had staff that died within so it has many spectral followers. Out of the corner of the character's eyes they can glimpse someone standing behind eachother. Every half hour spent in the manor house they roll a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.  
There's also a Man in the Mirror that haunts the manor home
