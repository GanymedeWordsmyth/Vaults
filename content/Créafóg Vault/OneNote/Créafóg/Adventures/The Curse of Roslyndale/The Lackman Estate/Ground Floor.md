Approaching the house, the party sees three children (the Lackman children), the eldest child, holding an infant, looks to be about 10, the middle child around 4 or 5, playing in the yard, being watched by a young woman (Westra). As the party approaches, the middle child runs to her mother and points to the party shouting excitedly, "Momma! They're back! My friends are here!" Which is then met with shallow belief deep enough to not discourage the child. The child then runs up to Yg, tags him on the shoulder, proclaims, "Tag! You're it!!" Then runs away. As she leaves, the four of them fade away.
