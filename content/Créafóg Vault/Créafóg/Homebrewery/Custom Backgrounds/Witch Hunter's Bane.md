Feature: The hunted becomes the hunter
	Not only have you found a way to survive being hunted, you've found a way to thrive in such an environment. You can feel when a witch hunter is within 1 mile of you and have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to discern whether you are a sorcerer. Additionally, after observing someone for at least 1 minute, you can make a Charisma (Insight) check to discern whether someone is a witch hunter. Further, if your check is successful by more than 5, you discern whether or not you are that hunter's target.
