Tiffany wants to play [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] again. She also wants her to become corrupted. A few details I'm considering:
	- The previous crew that [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] adventured with was a dream
	- [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] wandered away from the previous crew, as she is wont to do. Actually, I really like this one a lot. She wandered away from the crew, came across the gem somehow, though she doesn't recall how, then stumbles upon the new crew.
	- Steph's character awakens to find [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] standing above them, staring at them curiously

How the party meets:
	- I like the idea that one of the party members ([[Stacia Hal]]?) wakes up to [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] staring at them.
	- Jess wants [[Rose Pietragalla]] to meet the party via pickpocket attempt
	- [[Stacia Hal]] is a coyote and Pix is a half breed. Did [[Stacia Hal]] traffic Pix to safety?
	- [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]], [[Stacia Hal]], and [[Rose Pietragalla]] all know about the sewer guild, albeit for different reasons:
		○ [[Stacia Hal]] is a member of the Streets
		○ [[Rose Pietragalla]] is a thieves' guild freelancer
		○ [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] has already explored a lot of the sewers due to the previous game.
	- Okay, so I'm thinking:(remember to tell Steph the dangers of being a tiefling. She's likely coyoted a tiefling before and so would know how to properly prepare Pix for human civilization)
		○ [[Stacia Hal]] is bringing in Pix, cowled. The Streets always cowl their refugees before they entry Baile so no one can identify them. It is also because of human reactions to certain half breeds. If everyone's brought in with a cowl, everyone gets used to it.
		○ On the way towards the sewers, [[Rose Pietragalla]] fails to pickpocket the two of them. How does this fail? It's likely that it would have succeeded if not for ___. Make sure the conversation turns towards the sewers. Maybe let Steph know ahead of time that this convo should reveal [[Stacia Hal]] to be part of the Streets.
		○ Switching gears. Someone fed up with the Streets always bringing in new people rips off Pix's hood, revealing her as a tiefling, screaming, "See?! They bring demons into our midst!!!" Then it becomes a chase where [[Stacia Hal]] and Pix have to wade their way through an angry crowd towards the sewers. The trick is that they first have to lose the pursuers so they don't follow them and find out where the Streets do their planning and business.
		○ [[Rose Pietragalla]] will be paying very close attention to the commotion and intercept the two, saving them from the mob. I don't want the interception to take place right away, though. I want the first round or two to be [[Stacia Hal]] and Pix struggling to get away before deus ex comes out of nowhere. After [[Rose Pietragalla]] joins, there will be multiple checks and challenges for getting them into the sewers without anyone noticing. There are multiple entrances into the sewers, [[Rose Pietragalla]] would know them all. Challenges include:
			§ Reigniting the chase
			§ Taking a longer route
			§ Being attacked by one or two people
			§ A small group finding the crew and apprehending Pix. Or at least attempting to.
		○ After entering the sewers, the newly formed crew meets [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]] with Del.
