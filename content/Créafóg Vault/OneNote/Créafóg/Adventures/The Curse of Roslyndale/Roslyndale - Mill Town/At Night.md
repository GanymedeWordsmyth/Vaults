When the party goes to sleep, have them roll a Wisdom saving throw (DC12). Anyone that fails, gains the benefits of a short rest not a long rest.  
Because Roscey is a Holfin, he makes the save with advantage
 
The first night, the party shouldn't need a long rest so the ones that fail this save wake up for some unknown reason. **[If they all succeed, then all of them wake up for some unknown reason.]**
 
In reality, they woke up due to the loud explosion caused by the spell failure.
 
**Anything that was bought during the day become decrepit and unusable. The coins in the store they bought it from are still on the counter at the store from which they bought these items.**
 
If the party decides to go back to sleep, have them roll another Wisdom Saving throw. They skip to the next day regardless of pass or fail. If they fail, their sleep is wracked with nightmares. Have everyone who failed roll a Constitution Saving throw. For those that fail, their nightmares turned to night terrors. They wake with a level of exhaustion and don't benefit from a long rest.  
**This continues to happen every night spent in Roslyndale.**
 
Reads the following to those that failed their saving throw:
 
Something jostles you awake this night, though you aren't sure what. You remind yourself that it was probably just the town's evening wildlife. Lying with your eyes still closed trying to get back to sleep, you hear a child playing outside. What do you do?
 
When you open your eyes, you notice the modestly cared for room you fell asleep in is completely desolate. The walls are gray, the wall paper mostly peeling off. The floors are rotted and splintered. What do you do?
 
You walk down the stairs and the money you gave to the innkeeper is still on the counter. The innkeeper is nowhere in sight, although from experience, you know that most innkeepers live in one of the rooms in the inn. Those that arrive late, often ring the bell on the counter to summon the sleeping innkeeper. On the table where you ate only a few hours ago is a small pile of money. [The amount of money here is the amount of money the party spent, in the same denomination that the party spent it. Bonus: only tell them how much is there, don't tell them that it's the same amount they spent]  
**[If anyone reaches for and rings the bell on the counter, the clapper falls to the floor, old and rusted. Dull footsteps are heard down the hall but no one is there.]**
 
After you leave the inn, give me a prescription check **highest check notices that a second story window of the house across the way has a faint blue glow. If they go into a different house, they'll visit the Cotton house.**
