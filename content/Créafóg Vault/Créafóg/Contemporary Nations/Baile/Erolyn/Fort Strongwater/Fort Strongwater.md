Outpost built to help fend off the forest and create a safe passage between Fairfield and Port Aldshore

Story Threads: Playing through the main quests eventually yield Bogthorn items that are identified at the end
	Main quest: Find a way to stop the orcs from continuing their siege
		Scene 1: First time meeting as a group. Each has a reason to see Captain Bhaltair Gall.
		Scene 2: Find the orc encampment and get them to stop (negotiation or killing). Among the treasure is a scrap of parchment that reads, in Sylvan, "Midnight on the Street of Smoke" (Rogues in the party knows what this means). This is also where they find Gizmo.
		Scene 3: Return and have a meeting with Lord and Lady Dubh. Father Glas reports that an older woman has visited the church and requests that she be allowed to stay for a time. (This is Granny Gretta Greenteeth)
		Scene 4: Lord and Lady Dubh throw a feast for the heroes. Let them drink, play games, and get to know those around them. When the scene begins to slow, Father Glas pulls them aside and explains the missive.
		Scene 5: This is where the doppelgangers spring into action. When the battle is over, Granny approaches the group. If they didn't meet her earlier, she'll introduce herself.

Old notes: 
	Fort Strongwater. Erolyn is attempting to create another fort, Fort Strongwater. The local [orcs/goblins/bugbears?] have been making this very difficult. [Orc?] children have been known to bully and harass and even kill and pillage passing merchants as a rite of passage. Sometimes enslaving and raping the woman as half-orcs are prized as slave laborers and as such, can be sold as trade goods.
	 Eventually come across grimlock?
	 The [Duke] of Erolyn is has put a bounty on the orcs (3c per finger, 1s for a pair of ears, 2g per scalp, 5g per head, etc.) [need to print up a bounty poster]
