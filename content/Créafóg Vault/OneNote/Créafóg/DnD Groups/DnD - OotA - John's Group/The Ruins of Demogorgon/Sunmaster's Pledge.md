Pledge of the Mask of the Sunmaster:  
Oh Everlight, my all I pledge,  
Holy, Life-giving, Flame of hope.  
Light from within the soul emerge,  
Given by the Eternal Sun.  
The Lord's radiance shall I bear,  
with your sacred Fire forge my will,  
and with the Law guiding the heart,  
justice luminous shall be thee.
 
Now to the Dawn I rise,  
as Sunmaster thus I vow.
