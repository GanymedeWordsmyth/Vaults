The Lackman House, being the epicenter of the ritual, has been affected more strongly than the rest of the town. Time moves slower inside the house, as a whole, giving the party less time to explore the house before being cast to the entrance of the town.

- On the first night of discovering the house, start at 2 hours.
- Every night after that adjudicate the proper amount of time based off how quickly they traveled to the house after sun set, up to 4 hours. Remember that the house is locked and cannot be entered during the day. If it is entered, the house is as lavishly decorated and fully functioning as it would have been before the incident.
- The ritual affected each room differently and as such time moves differently when in each room. The description of each room has a time dilation tag where you add or subtract an amount of time dependent on how long they spent in said room from the time limit. For every real time minute they spend in a room, multiply that from the Time Dilation factor and subtract the resulting number from the time limit.
- Pause the timer in combat. Every 10 non-continuous rounds of combat, subtract 1 minute from the time limit

During the day, Lackman House is lively and full of staff. Mistress Lackman is out doing errands. Portraits of her, her children, and her butler are scattered through the estate. Especially portraits of her children. The manor is well decorated with fine curtains and windows. There many rooms including a grand ball room that she opens up during holidays to the town as an event hall. Two stories and an attic that runs through most of the house. There are also secret corridors behind the walls that the staff uses to travel between rooms.
 
I want the characters to find the black dress and veil.
 
It looks like this is going to turn into a dungeon crawl xD
 
**Remember: there is a residual haunting that causes all the characters to make a DC13 Constitution save every hour spent in here at night or gain one level of exhaustion.**
 
**After they solve the riddle of Lackman House, they are able to go out back into the court yard where they see the ritual fail (read the clearing path of Damp√©'s dream), turning Mistress Lackman into a Wispmother.**
 
**Set a timer for 4 hours. If the session ends before the timer, mark down the remaining time and start the next session at that time (after the recap). When the timer is up, transition them to the entrance of the town at the morning of day 1 a la Majora's Mask (note: even though the party's first arrival was at dusk, this arrival is in the morning. This will give them extra time to unravel the mystery). Their progress through the whole town resets but their knowledge stays. This includes all found loot and treasure!**  
**Remember to describe their first encounter with the Mistress. She'll have the same response no matter which store she first encounters them in. The shop keep will have a similar response to the first one as well.**  
**Transitions:**  
**As you enter the room, you step through and**  
**You take a step forward through the hallway and**  
**The walls around you disolve away and**  
**The floor gives way beneath you sending you down into a pit of black darkness. You**
 
**...find yourselves approaching a town in the distance. You notice the town is a little run down, the buildings could use some love and attention. Allanon, give me a perception check (DC13 reveals a faint ozone smell in the air). As the sun leaves the horizon on the rise, what do you do?**
 
Entering the estate at night:  
As you enter the Lackman House, a blinding light flashes behind you, illuminating **describe the room they enter**, accompanied by a grand crash **kouphhhhh** a heavy thrumming sound can be heard on the outside of the house. **shpphhhhhh** **play rain sounds** what do you do?

The Study (first floor bedroom on the map):  
As you step into the room, you hear a k-tik as the door closes gently behind you. **[The door is locked and jammed and can't be picked]** The left wall is lined with books and a desk sits centered on the right side of the room. A large bay window on the wall directly in front of you. Framing the desk are three beautifully painted pictures. The large painted on the left depicts Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface. The large painting on the right is of Minuris shining resplendantly in the midnight sky. The trees beneath her gleaming rays glowing majestically. The long lanscaped painting bridging the two behind the desk limns Veraudinaus standing handsome and proud at his zenith in the sky, raining down heavenly light illuminating a magnificent town beneath. The floor is elegantly inlaid with **different types of wood** and on the ceiling crawls delicately carved crossbeams.
 
Lightning sprints across the sky just above the estate **kouphhhh** the sound of thunder almost deafening. The drumming of the rain becomes heavier and heavier. As the bay window begins to leak, you look down and find yourself standing in low water. Looking behind you, the door is also leaking. Water spews from the books, from the paintings. The room is quickly filling, as the water level rises. **Hey google, start a five minute timer**. What do you do?
 
1. Water rises up to Allanon's knees
2. Now it is as high as his stomach
3. As the water rises to Allanon's shoulders, Yg and Roscey's feet lift off the floor.
4. Allanon's feet lift off the floor as the water level reach Dampe's shoulders.
5. The water continues to rise to the ceiling. You have to smash your face against the cross beams justto continue breathing.

**When Allanon shifts read the following:**  
_Conjuring the image of the animal in your mind, you reach down through the roots of your consciousness into that place within you where your magic rests. You pause as you search around a moment. You find nothing. You realize there is no well of magic. Your connection is completely gone. You open your eyes a human._
 
After a few moments, your release the last of your breath, and your arms go slack. Yg and Roscey first. Then Dampe. Finally Allanon. One by one each of you begins to lose consciousness. You feel yourselves descend slowly towards the floor.
 
Landing gently, your bodies righting themselves feet down, you look around the room. The left wall is lined with books and a desk sits centered on the right side of the room. A large bay window on the wall directly in front of you. Framing the desk are three beautifully painted pictures. The large painted on the left depicts Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface. The large painting on the right is of Minuris shining resplendently in the midnight sky. The trees beneath her gleaming rays glowing majestically. The long landscaped painting bridging the two behind the desk limns Veraudinus standing handsome and proud at his zenith in the sky, raining down heavenly light illuminating a magnificent town beneath. The floor is elegantly inlaid with different types of wood and on the ceiling crawls delicately carved crossbeams.
