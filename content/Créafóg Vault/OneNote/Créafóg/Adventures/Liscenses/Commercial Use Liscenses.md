Gnome Factory special:  
CC licenses don't really fit the purpose of selling assets, so here is my own license:
 
You may use my assets for all non-commercial purposes, no attribution required. So share your maps on reddit all you like! I only ask that you don't redistribute the assets themselves without my consent.
 
If you are subscribed to the Assembly Supervisor ($6.50) tier you may publish up to 10 products (map packs, adventures,...) each month you are subscribed. Again, no attribution necessary (but of course appreciated!).
 
Commercial use encompasses anything that helps you earn money, either by selling products or by promoting money-making ventures.
