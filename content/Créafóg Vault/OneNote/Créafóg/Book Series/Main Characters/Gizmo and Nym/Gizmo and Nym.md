Artificer's Lore  
Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.  
Tinker  
Proficiency in tinker's tools  
Spend 1 hour and 10 gp to make a clockwork device (AC5, 1hp) that lasts for 24 hours before needing to be repaired (by spending 1 hour to do so). You can also use your action to dismantle it and reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time:  
Clockwork toy.  
This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.  
Fire starter.  
The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.  
Music Box.  
When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.

Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk (Gnomes):  
As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do.
