Heavens' Chronical  
Armillary sphere hints on which plane it is currently on. Though you still need to know about the planes in order to be able to read it.  
Astrolabe is used once you know which plane you are on. Name the plane of existence and it and its discs will shift to calibrate itself to the current plane.  
Astrolabe discs are in the hidden pull out drawer on its base.  
Order of operations:  
While on a plane or planet and command the Chronical to shift the armillary sphere, then interpret it to give you which plane(t) you're on  
Command the Heavens' Chronical to shift to an astrolabe. The stand will also shift to be able to hold the astrolabe vertically.  
Name the plane or planet you are on to calibrate the astrolabe and its discs  
Pull a disc out from the Chronicle's base that corresponds to your current location on the plane/planet you're on.  
**The Heavens' Chronical might need to help its user to find the correct stuff?**
