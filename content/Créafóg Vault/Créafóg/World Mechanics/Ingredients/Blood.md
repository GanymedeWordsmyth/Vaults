Smithing
	From a medium creature, someone proficient in medicine can extract up to 6 pints of blood. Each size creature above medium has twice the previous pints of blood of the previous size.
	Using the blood of a creature, a blacksmith can make ammunition or melee weapons of creature bane that does extra damage to the exact type of creature from which the blood was harvest (black dragon bane arrows won't deal extra damage to a green dragon).
	It takes a minimum of 4 pints of blood to make one melee weapon of creature bane. The more pints of blood you use, the more powerful the bane.
		4 pints increase the damage by 1d6
		6 pints by 1d8
		8 pints by 1d10
		10 pints by 1d12
	Each pint of blood can make 3 pieces of ammunition of creature bane.
