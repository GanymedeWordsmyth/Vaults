There are three levels of drugs, listed weakest and most volatile to strongest and most stable: laced, impure, and pure. Described are the pure versions of the drug. Impure versions are half the cost, benefit half as much, and draw back twice as much. Laced versions of a drug are generally laced with some other minor drug, which can cause a **host of problems.**
