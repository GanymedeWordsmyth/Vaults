Ki, Church, Shava  
Grim, Kithri, Smoke  
Gizmo, Nym
 
First major arc  
Having collected information about the Curator, the Grip sent Ki, Church, and Shava (and her shadow) as their first mission to place traps and undermine the oblex's hold and create a foothold of their own. Whereas, this troupe isn't directly escorted, ~~the Grip has spies throughout the city to keep an eye on them and their mission~~. Better yet, the Grip does, indeed, have spies in the city, but instead, the Grip hired multiple troupes to take care of this problem and the troupe that accomplishes this is accepted into the lower ranks of the Grip.  
The Curator, having heard about the movement of the Grip, is collecting **stuff** to defend their turf  
Sounds like this is going to turn into the group working for the Grip will clash against the group working for the Curator. This implies that since both the Curator and the Grip have multiple operatives, they are all going to clash at one point or another. Although, this story is largely going to follow these two specific groups.
 
Moments  
Gizmo and Nym keep their distance, but inevitably fail one of their stealth checks and one of the others spy them and rip them out of stealth.
