- TW/CW: Themes of plague aftermath, death, and one scene with child death at the end (non gory).
- What clues can be found in Westra's room?
- Secret areas in the Estate
    
    - Zoetrope song for organ secret
        
        - The song played by the zoetrope is a song that Mr Lackman came up with as a magical device for his family.
        - When the notes from the zoetrope is played on the organ,
- Make a Lackman House file with labeled rooms
- Add a "what's next" page detailing what happens after the party finishes the adventure and loot that is there when they inherit the village.
- Something else to include in the book would be atmospheric music suggestions.
- ~~Make the main pantry larger.~~
- The mystery of the first floor. Basically, this is what would be called in videogames an unlisted puzzle. Nothing outside of the clues will hint at its existence. Not the Lackmans, not the victorian man, not Mole. This will act to reward the curious. Some kind of puzzle that includes the paintings, maybe a few vases, and the hearths. This is what leads to the basement and is the only way down. There is also a collapsed tunnel that acted like an escape route leading far from the village. It has since collapsed further than can be explored with a full night of clearing. If they wish to continue doing so, have them eventually hit the fog wall.
    
    - Actually, this could lead to a neat combat encounter. Either something comes out of the fog, or something block the exit, forcing them to fight to leave.
- ~~So, instead of the Lackman House restarting every morning, what if the house, being removed from time, is also removed from it's spacial instance as well. Once the characters go into the house, they are no longer in Roslyndale and as such are now trapped in the house until they defeat the Mistress and Mr. Cotton.~~
    
    - ~~The decision is comes from the fact that previously, the party had a constricted amount of time to finish what amounted to a very large puzzle, which they already had to do just to get here. If they get very far, but not far enough, they are likely to get frustrated with this part, since before the house moved even faster through time than the rest of the town.~~
    - ~~This would explain why the cari and dybbuks aren't found in the random encounter charts for the house (when in truth, I haven't made them yet xD )~~
- Lackman House random encounters. The rooms, balconies, and patios already have something happening in them when the players first enter them, so this is mainly for the hallways. Although, they can be included for after the party already clears out the room, or when things get stale. Oh, duh, ==let the RE chart speak for the basement, the offices, and the rooms in the servan'ts quarters==. That'll be a cool idea. My biggest issue is that every time I put something in an RE chart, I end up really liking the idea and trying to put it somewhere in the adventure. Include: **residual hauntings, Kethra sightings, very easy combat, roleplay, and puzzle (can serve to hint at the top floor puzzle and get the players in the mindset of solving) encounters.**
- ~~Remake maps in DungeonDraft~~
- Should the Penitent Warrior go in the event hall with some animated suits of armor?
    
    - This is an awesome idea and I really like it a lot. In addition to stats, also make a fight strategy tree.
    - The amount of suits that come to life equal the party size minus 1. This number stays constant so long as there are suits to activate. The Penitent Warrior then activates when all others have been defeated.
    - **The suits of armor activate when someone…**
- Need stats and fight strategy trees for
    
    - Mistress Lackman
    - Gorren Ramski
    - Henry Cotton
    - Kairon? (will the party fight or be assisted by them? Come up with some catch phrases for vicious mockery and bardic inspiration)
    - The Wailer romero
    - The Penitent Warrior fight strategy, background, and loot
- Make a sidebar of what happens if the players dispel the church. This doesn't need to be a full section
    
    - What happens if your players decide to to dispel the protective barrier in the church?
    - Maybe nothing happens. The area is from a divine influence so strong that when when combined with thhhe eeffects of the spell failure, the area became permanent and immune to any mortal means of dispelling it. Maybe thhhe area becomes dispelled as exppected, the memories (thhe people and area the partyyy interacts with) all fade away, leaving nothhing more than a drab, gray, annd ddelapidated space, just likke the rest of the town.
    - Something that worked really well for me was leaning into the Grove's backstory and abilities. Being of a very high level, they likely accumulated at least a couple very powerful items and artifacts and after settling down, they needed a place to hide them. Luckily for them, they have an equally high level wizard in their party who likes to hide things in plain sight, behind a thin veil of illusion. The chosen illusion in this case being the entire chuch map as a whole, including the basement area, using the mirage arcane spell to shape the area into what is seen today. Beneath veil was a moderate sized stone on a plinth surrounded by moderate sized menhirs sealing in the evil the resided within the stone. What evil resided within the stone? I wasn't quite sure yet, but I was playing around with a few different ideas that would slowly form over the course of the campaign and possibly be the end boss. My favorite idea was that it housed a part of the soul of Fraz-Urb'luu; see Fraz-Urb'luu's Gem in WotC's Out of the Abyss module.
- ~~Come up with the nursery rhyme that points to the children's books~~
- ~~Figure out the children's book~~
- Chess match pieces' boons and curses ~~and how to adjudicate the outcome~~ Too complicated, just make a roll table or choose the one that's most appropriate.
- ~~Chapel ground floor and chamber floor encounters~~
    
    - ~~Ground floor is a fight~~
        
        - ~~What if the chapel ground floor fight was against spiders. Except Dampé is basically their queen ever since killing the Matron and being bestowed the gift of the Matron's Folly~~
        - ~~Would the spiders sense it immediately or would they obey once she summoned her spiders? If the latter, what happens if she doesn't summon the spiders?~~
        - ~~No, I think the spiders would descend hungrily, really talk this part up, looking from one member to the next, until finally their gaze looks to Dampé and at once, their aggression dissolves~~
        - ~~The party walks into the room and must make a Dex (?) save or be stuck in a giant mat of spider webs. As they try to struggle free, the spiders descend from the floor above, eyeing each hungrily, until they see Dampé, then their aggression fades. It is now that Dampé realizes she can still move, even through the webbing. If she tries to climb the webs, she can, and with relative ease. (She has the web sense and web walker traits. Does she have the spider climb trait? Probably not). Some movement occurs in the webs which only the spiders and Dampé can sense, and all of them look hungrily in that direction and the spiders lunge towards the movement.~~
    - ~~Okay so here's the narrative:~~
    - ~~Spirits on the upper level.~~
- Dining room encounter
    
    - The dining room is pretty tight, so fighting in here could be a problem. Similar to the chapel room, but that serves a purpose. I feel like this encounter shouldn't be a fight. Maybe a negotiation? Another interaction with Kethra? There are already a lot of cutscenes in this module as a whole, so I don't want another cut scene. I want something actionable.
    - Witnessing a dinner party. Heward and Westra Lackman at the dais table. A bunch of people at the dinner tables. Everyone stopped mid-doing stuff, like someone hit the pause button in the middle of a movie, but also flickering, like a bunch of glitching holograms. The players entering doesn't trigger anything to happen. What if nothing is supposed to happen? This could be another route of clues to unlock the top floor. Or this is a riddle that, if solved, gives the players something epic, but otherwise doesn't effect the storyline in any way.
    - So, what would be earned, and what is the riddle? Let's make it something legendary, and a riddle that's very difficult to solve. This isn't a spell or spell effect, so it can't be dispelled (I'm looking at you Allanon). More importantly, I want it to be memorable. Basically, if the players don't solve it, I want them to forever wonder what was up with that room.
    - There's a really cool episode of Doctor Who where he and his companion go into a haunted house, but the house is plagued with the first human time traveler who got stuck between the timelines and in order to solve the riddle, the Doctor had to use the Tardis to take pictures from different points in time to string together that the girl was saying "help". This sent the Doctor down a rabbit hole where he had to open a portal to the collapsing space-timeline.
    - Maybe these phantoms are thusly because of the spell failure, their visage spread throughout all space-time. I like that premise a lot, but how does that translate? It took a 900 something year old Galafreyan with a literal time machine to figure it out.
    - I like the idea of being brought to a completely different area after solving the riddle. From there, the objective is very clear and straight forward and completing said objective yields a great reward. Although clear and straight forward does not mean easy. I also like the idea that there's more to the story than what's on the surface. Like there's a not-so-obvious side objective that only the clever (read: the ones who are paying attention) will see. Completing this objective either strengthens the reward of the main objective or directly effects the events to come, such as making the final boss easier to fight or stops the factory reset every morning. Something big.
    - So, come up with the clear objective after the scene change and the riddle and reward should be obvious. The underlining objective will probably be a little more difficult to achieve. (Vawdrey tomb? I kind of want to, but that also has a scene change in it. Would I want two scene changes?)
    - Okay, maybe not the Vawdrey tomb, but what if this has to do with the cari? It keeps it relevant by making use of what's already there instead of introducing yet another thing.
    - Solving the riddle brings them to an area where all speech is understood, where the characters are free to move around, and they have to rescue someone (Kethra?) before something happens (being sought after by the dybbuks to kill and by the cari possibly for capture and study, the theme of these two being enemies has already been stated by this point). The underlining objective is to talk to and negotiate with the cari (maybe the cari look different in this realm).
    - When the players enter, they see the scene described above where everyone is frozen. Is Kethra free to move, or is she also frozen hiding in a corner?
        
        - If she is free to move, she does a thing and gets sucked into a vortex.
        - **If she is frozen, when the players find and approach her, she is plucked into the dimension.**
    - Either way, the riddle is figuring out how to get where Kethra is. In her timeline, this happens after the players save her from the spiders in the chapel.
    - Really play up the frozen phantoms, creepy music, oddly silent, etc. Get the players invested and creeped out. Then play out the Kethra bit.
- ~~Write the servant's break room scene. Things to keep in mind:~~
    
    - ~~Lackman house removed from time. A phantom man wearing victorian clothing is seen around the premisese through different windows. This could get players who are curious to leave the house, and experience the exterior. The man is a victorian ghost hunter. Maybe the man leads the players into the fog wall. In his timeline, the house is a famous ghost house turned into a museum. Have him name the PCs as the heroes of the house to a group of tourists that can't be seen, and explain some of the behind the scenes mechanics. "Legend has it that..."~~
    - ~~When the characters enter, the rain sound stops entirely, as does all noise. Also, describe a glowing orb afixed to the ceiling. When the victorian man is finished speaking to the tourists, he leads them out of the room (remember only the man is visible in the vision), flicks something on the wall and the glowing orb goes dark, then fades away after a few minutes.~~
    - **Is the man encountered again in the house? Basement, Servant's quarters, butler's room**
    - ~~If anyone looks outside, the rain fall is still present, but the water drops hang mid fall, as though time has stopped~~
    - ~~Put on lofi beats~~
    - ~~Maybe the characters are in staff clothing, ghosts lounging in the chairs and at the desks.~~
    - ~~This is a space that should make sense. It's a respite from the crazy shit that's happening. It's somewhere the characters can retreat to think without fear of anything to get them.~~
    - ~~Should the latent ambient haunting be paused here too?~~
- ~~Populate the house keeper's office, the chef's office, and the butler's pantry~~
- ~~Populate chamber floor~~
    
    - **Still need:**
        
        - ~~Butler's room~~
        - ~~House Keeper's room (the small room in the servant's quarters that only had two beds)~~
        - ~~Servant's quarters (make some loot tables for the chests. Include a rare instance of a stolen magic item or book.)~~
    - ~~YOOO!!! Okay so, Kethra. She knows well the players by the time they get to the chamber floor. The house timeline is splintered, so she would also see the "blue woman" but, because of her visage, Kitty wouldn't know the woman is her mother and would be afraid of her. When the players are in Kethra's room, they see the Mistress as the wispmother with her arms out towards a still living Kethra screaming in terror as she tries to get away from her. When Kitty sees the party enter, she calls them over to help, sending the Mistress into a rage.~~
    - ~~In Silifrey's room, Frey is seen playing with a doll house and the Mistress is in front of her attempting to play with her. This, of course, doesn't work as she is largely incorporeal. She ends up getting frustrated and force throws (poltergeist stat block) a piece at the wall towards the party, which alerts her to the party's presence.~~
    - ~~In Bran's room, they see the blue woman again weeping as she tries to pick him up from his cradle, but is unable to do so. A frightened, but bolstered Kitty swings a glowing stick at the woman, which seems to connect. The Mistress turns to Kitty holding the stick and she runs behind the party for protection. When the party fends off the Mistress, Kitty gifts the glowing stick to the party~~
        
        - ~~What is the stick? Treat it as a quarter staff imbued with some inconsequential, possibly even faulty, spell created by an amateur artificer~~
        - ~~A slightly royal blue glow emanates from the stick making it a source of dim light for out to 5ft. A slight~~ **whirring/humming/clicking (choose one)** ~~can be heard from it as well.~~
    - ~~In the Mistress' room, pretty much exactly what happens in the vision before the adventure happens here. The Mistress, distraught, is stretched over her bed that is lined with three child-sized bodies. One of the children, Kitty, looks over to the party as they enter and whispers, "Goodbye old friends," before closing her eyes one more time. A floorboard creaks underfoot and the Mistress glances up in a rage, attempting to force throw the character who had the vision into the closet.~~
    - ~~Every time the Mistress is defeated in a someone's room, she floats through the wall into another. When she is fought off in her own room, the Mistress disappears through the ceiling into the top floor. This is when the players have to actually solve the riddle to gain access.~~
    - ~~Put in plenty of instances of Kethra seeing and interacting with the party. Make sure also to emphasize her different ages. In the main room, have Mistress Lackman haning over the children's dying bodies and Kethra looks over at them, smiling as they enter before closing her eyes one final time.~~
- ~~Top floor, final showdown~~
    
    - ~~Along with stats for Mistress Lackman and Mr Cotton, write down battle strategies (reread the intro to The Monsters Know What They're Doing for inspiration)~~
- ~~The Grove stats~~
- Populate appendices
- Magic items in the estate
- Estate contents
- Table of contents
- ~~Change any mention of the tempus cari to other monsters. The cari are mostly my own setting.~~ Maybe I'll actually keep these because they're wicked cool. Also, it adds a little more diversity to have a couple factions already fighting eachother for what's in this place.
- Rewrite the Roslyndale Dream section so it can more generically represent any players that play this adventure

~~As you all enter the room, I need everyone to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16).~~ **Announce that this is a cut scene.** ~~Anyone that succeeds jumps back out of the room but can still see inside moving at a much slower pace than yourself. Those that failed are restrained as you walk face first into a massive spiders' web.~~  
**Describe the area.**  
~~As you struggle to get free, 4 massive spiders descend staring hungrily at their prey. Allanon and Yg here a clicking sound from Dampé as she moves through the webs. It sounds like some kind of language, but you are unfamiliar of which.~~  
~~Dampé: a commanding tone instinctually escapes your throat as you walk forward and up through the webs towards the spiders, entirely unhindered, the spiders hanging on every word and obeying your command.~~  
~~Dampé's command: (send this to Niki in a private message)~~  
~~I don't entirely know how your Dampé would say this, but the words that seem to come from a place deep inside your soul are: I am your Matron now. You will join my side and fight for me. You will live to serve me. You will die to protect me. These are my companions, treat them as though they are me.~~  
~~Before you can finish, there is a slight movement in the webbing from the upper floor and the spiders turn and run towards it fervently. To your surprise you know exactly where on the web this disturbance originated. Do you follow them?~~
