Fearthainne Solasta (now Fearthainne Vawdrey since his master's death) the druid (with Coillte, a faery dragon familiar inherited by each Vawdrey successor)  
With the death of the preceding Vawdrey, Coillte regenerates and becomes a red dragon. Coillte grows (and levels) with the current Vawdrey. The stronger the Vawdrey becomes, the stronger Coillte becomes.
 
Coillte's scales change colors every 3 levels that the current Vawdrey achieves.
