ACTIONS
 
**Multiattack:** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.  
**Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.  
**Hand Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.  
**Wand of Viscid Globs:** 7 charges. Each charge causes a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of the wielder. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcaster level (or Int mod for non spellcasters) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hr. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.  
Applying a pint or more of alcohol dissolves the glob instantly, as does that application of _oil of etherealness_ or _universal solvent_. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it falls away on its own.  
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed. The wand is also destroy if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.
