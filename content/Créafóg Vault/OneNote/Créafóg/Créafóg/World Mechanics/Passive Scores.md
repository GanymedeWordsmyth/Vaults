Passive scores act as the floor for opposing active rolls
 
I.e.  
Passive perception acts as a floor for active stealth  
If an active stealth roll is below the opposing passive perception, the perceiver has a chance to spot the stealther by rolling an active perception roll. If the active perception roll is below the active stealth roll, the perceiver doesn't see the stealther but knows they are around. This gives the stealther one more try to attempt stealth again using the perceiver's active perception roll as the new DC.
