Understood. Here's a revised version of Mr. Cotton's backstory that incorporates these details:
 
### Mr. Cotton's Backstory in Roslyndale:
 
Mr. Cotton, a sorcerer in a world where such individuals are hunted by the Sovereign Concordat's witch hunters, found refuge in Roslyndale under the protection of Mr. Heward Lackman. Initially, Heward kept Cotton's true identity a secret, even from his own family, to ensure his safety.
 
### The Unintended Discovery and a Mother's Grief:
 
The secret remained well-guarded until Silifrey, Heward's telepathic daughter, accidentally discovered the truth about Cotton. She innocently shared this revelation with her mother, Mistress Westra Lackman, not fully grasping the perilous implications of being a sorcerer. Initially, the Mistress agreed to keep his secret, understanding the danger he faced.
 
However, the subsequent tragic loss of her children – Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn – to a devastating plague plunged Mistress Lackman into deep despair. Her overwhelming grief eventually led her to exploit the knowledge of Cotton's true identity. Desperate to bring her children back, she resorted to blackmailing him, leveraging his secret to coerce him into performing a resurrection spell.
 
### The Forced Ritual and Its Consequences:
 
Bound by the Mistress's blackmail and the weight of his hidden identity, Cotton attempted the resurrection, despite the spell being beyond his mastery. The premature and forced execution of this complex magical ritual ended in catastrophe, unleashing a disastrous shockwave that not only extinguished all life in Roslyndale but also trapped the spirits of its residents, including the Mistress's children who were transformed into Will-o'-Wisps.
 
### A Tale of Desperation and Tragedy:
 
In this narrative, Mr. Cotton's story is a poignant example of how desperation and secrecy can lead to unforeseen tragedy. His initial refuge with the Lackman family, meant to be a haven from a world that feared and persecuted him, ironically became the epicenter of a new calamity. The Mistress's transformation from a protector of his secret to his blackmailer underlines the complex dynamics of grief, desperation, and the unintended consequences that can arise from them. This backstory weaves a rich tapestry of characters and motives, adding depth and complexity to the narrative of Roslyndale's curse.
