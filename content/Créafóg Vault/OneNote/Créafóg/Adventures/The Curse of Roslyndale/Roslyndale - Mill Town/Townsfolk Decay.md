No matter what stage of decay the townsfolk are in, as soon as the sun sets, during the short period of twilight, everyone snaps back to looking and acting like they did on day one, even if they were in the middle of a fight, and will no longer be hostile towards the party. As the twilight fades, their bodies fade with it, until they are completely gone. The bodies of the children during this time fade to wisps.
 
On arrival day, everyone is pleasant and sickly sweet  
1st day  
People start to look sickly.  
They are still pleasant, but slightly more irritable as one is when they have a mild stomach ache.  
2nd day  
People look gaunt and have random bruises all over their bodies  
Their eyes are pale and glazed  
The ends of their appendages are blue and discolored.  
Their pleasant demeanor is replaced with mild hostility "why are you here" and "you don't belong here" and "why are you bothering us" and "when will you be leaving?"  
In the middle of the town square are 3 dead bodies. The townsfolk don't notice the presence of these bodies and when asked, they donâ€™t see them even when shown and are genuinely confused about their existence.  
3rd day  
The skin around the peoples' mouths have tightened to the point where their teeth are showing more  
Their eyes are fully sunken  
Their noses are shrunken to the point where you can almost see their nose bones  
Their skin is paper thin and their bones show through  
Their nails and teeth looks like they've grown and have yellowed.  
The party is now met with open hostility, though the townsfolk will not yet fight them. "How dare you disturb us" and "you being here is the Mistress's fault" and "the Cottons put you up to this didn't they?"  
4th day onwards  
Everyone goes full Romero. If the party kills anyone, they respawn the next day.  
The dead during the day are immune to all physical damage not dealt from magical weapons  
The townsfolk are now hostile and will attack the party on sight, though they are slow and have troubles keeping up.  
5th day onwards: (I am adding these in because I think they are neat, but I don't believe I can add these into the bit that I'll sell. Though I may call attention to this fact)  
Some of the Romeroes mutate to form special undead  
- [x] **The Glutton (Boomer)**: 1HP; replace the Slam attack with a Bile attack, reach 15ft cone, acid damage. When the boomer is reduced to 0hp, it explodes, and everyone within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 4 (1d6+1) acid damage  
- [x] **The Stalker (Hunter)**: Extremely agile, high Dex, with spider climb; Add to Slam: if the hunter moves 10 feet in a straight line towards the target, the target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they are knocked prone and grappled by the hunter as it straddles the target. Add a Claw attack, can only be used on a target it is grappling for 4 (1d6+1) slashing damage  
- [x] **The Smoker**: replace the slam attack with a tongue attack: reach 10feet, on a hit, the attack does no damage, but the smoker is now grappling the target. It spends subsequent turns blinding the target by breathing smoke in the target's face until freed.  
- [x] **The Tank**: Incredible strength and constitution; replace slam attack with a hurl action, when the tank moves 10 feet towards a target, the target makes a DC 15 strength check or be hurled up to 30 feet away from the tank. If the target is hurled into a wall, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet remaining before hitting the wall, otherwise they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage when they land on the ground. Chuck: if there is a large stone slab or something similar around the tank, it can chuck it up to 30 feet, using its strength for the attack roll. Vulnerable to fire.  
- [ ] **The Witch**: High hp and damage output, but low everything else. Crying can be heard in proximity to the witch. Will only attack the one who disturbs her until dead or poisoned, then will run away. Claw attack: reach 5ft, damage 2d10 slashing plus 3d10 poison make a Con save or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated and paralyzed.
