The most wronged by the Bailens in her opinion. She is the one trying to invade Baile via Port Aldshore, as she sees it as a weak point in the chain. Her intention is to undermine and destabilize the Bailen government little by little until it is all destroyed.
 
In order to get to Port Aldshore, she would have to go through the Painted Lady's demesne, which would require at least a temporary alliance between the two.
 
Why does the Painted Lady agree to this alliance?
