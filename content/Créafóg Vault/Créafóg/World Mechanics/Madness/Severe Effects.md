0.75≤Ψ<1.0
- Loss of Self: Characters face significant periods of confusion, memory loss, or assume alternate personalities. They may act out of character, driven by delusions or commands from unseen voices.
- Ethereal Existence: Extended phases into the Ethereal Plane, making it difficult to interact with the material world. Characters might require assistance from others to anchor themselves in reality or risk being lost to the Ethereal Plane temporarily.
- Ethereal Harmony: Once per long rest, the character can fully harmonize their essence with the Ethereal Plane, gaining profound insights or manipulating the ethereal energies. This could include compelling ethereal entities to aid them, accessing hidden knowledge, or influencing the outcome of ethereal phenomena.  The intense union with the Ethereal Plane leaves the character "Ethereally Overexposed," making them visible and vulnerable to all ethereal entities. For 24 hours after using this ability, they attract ethereal predators, cannot hide from beings on the Ethereal Plane, and suffer disadvantage on all actions directly involving ethereal creatures or energies.
