Preclassic/Formative: Olmec people were the first complex civilization to develop Mesoamerica. Mayans were developed in the Middle and Late Preclassic period  
Classic: Teotihuac√°n (city, not polity) in central Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala, Zapotec in Oaxaca  
Late Classic: Large decrease in Tikal's socio-political and economic power. The Tikal rose again by building strong alliances and defeating its worst enemies. In the Mayan area, the Late Classic ended with the so-called "Mayan Collapse"
