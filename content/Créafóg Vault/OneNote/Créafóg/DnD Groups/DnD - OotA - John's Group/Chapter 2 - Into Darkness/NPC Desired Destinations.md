Buppido urges PCs towards Gracklstugh from southern route. Can find a route to Gracklstugh via Darklake  
Jimjar ambivalent but can guide to Blingdenstone  
Topsy and Turvey can also guide to Blingdenstone, but are reluctant to do so. They support any suggestion that will not take the party home.

Derendil, Eldeth, Ront, and Stool can't give any useful directions
 
Stool is desperate to return to Neverlight Grove, pleading with the characters to take it there. It claims that its people will be grateful and offer the party shelter and aid. It also describes its sovereign as wise in the hidden ways of the Underdark.
