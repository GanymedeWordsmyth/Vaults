Temporary pools where each character pools their tokens together for an adventure, then gets back out the same percentage of tokens they put in. This will prevent coin mining where characters constantly only adventure with people that have more tokens. This system can also be over ruled if the players have a different strategy for reclaiming individual tokens after a mission.
