The Founding of the Streets  
The Streets were established first as a response to the burgeoning need for a network dedicated to the liberation and protection of those oppressed by the emerging societies and powers in the world. Their formation was driven by powerful beings and visionaries who saw the necessity of operating in the shadows to effect real change.
 
The Rise of Aldshore  
As civilizations grew, the town of Aldshore was commissioned and built. Its strategic location and burgeoning economy made it a hub of commerce and politics.
 
The Street of Smoke’s Relocation  
The Street of Smoke, initially operating in a different region, found its activities increasingly hampered by heightened security measures and the evolving sophistication of its adversaries. Seeking a new base from which to operate more effectively, they chose Aldshore, drawn by its complex infrastructure and the possibilities its sewers and hidden places offered.
 
Discovery of the Oblex and the Formation of the Museum  
Upon arriving in Aldshore, Caius Varr, the human guise of the chromatic blue dragon, Borexaanvir, intrigued by the potential of human society and in the midst of formulating an experiment on freedom and governance, discovered an oblex lurking in the city's sewers. This oblex, having remained hidden since the city's early days, had quietly observed and learned from the surface world.
 
Recognizing the oblex’s potential for both assistance and disruption, Caius struck a deal: he would grant the sewers to the oblex, allowing it to establish its domain and form what would become known as the Museum, in exchange for the oblex's non-interference with his plans for the Street of Smoke and its activities. The oblex, seeing an opportunity to expand its own understanding and influence, agreed, becoming the Curator.
 
Mutual Coexistence and Hidden Agendas  
The Museum, under the Curator's guidance, became a front for the Street of Smoke’s operations, as well as a repository for knowledge, artifacts, and secrets from both the surface world and the depths below. The Curator, with its vast intellect and curiosity, pursued its objectives, all while maintaining the pact with Caius.
 
This arrangement allowed the Street of Smoke to thrive in Aldshore, benefiting from the secrecy and protection offered by the Museum's sewers. Meanwhile, Caius could continue his experiment with the dynamics of power, freedom, and societal change, all under the guise of fighting for the liberation of slaves and the oppressed.
 
A Delicate Balance  
This narrative structure creates a delicate balance of power, secrecy, and ambition. The Curator and Caius, each with their own goals, operate in a symbiotic relationship that, while fragile, serves the interests of both. The Museum and the Street of Smoke become intertwined in the fate of Aldshore, shaping its destiny from the shadows.
