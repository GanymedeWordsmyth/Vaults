Starting Ep3 during the evening of day 1

Capt suggested she wants to tell people about the oblexes. This includes the Shields, the Lord, and the hospitals (stop sending people down there!)
Possibly desire to go to the harbormaster to check out what's up with the lighthouse (completely unrelated to orcs...oh, is this where they find out about the invading guild).
Didn't get the chance to tell them about the invading thieves' guild, so when they collect for the oblexes, tell them then. Actually, is it not a thieves guild, but rather a counter-smugglers ring?

Who to tell?
	[[Captain Enid Morgan]]
		[[Lieutenant Commander Eva Massingham]]
		[[Senior Lieutenant Lesley Knowles]]
	[[Lord Stewart Irvine]]
Notable places and people to visit
	[[Esvele Tallstag]] at the [[Dapper Dolphin]]
	[[Ã¾urok]] at the [[Shark's Respite]]
	The Bathhouse
	The Apothecary

Dealing with the Yurtrus orcs will tell them of the Red Hand orcs, "the bear women foretold the first to ransack a city will have favor from our god to overthrow [[Grutok the Brutal]]. And if anyone is worthy of this, it's [[Ruhk the Filthy]]" (make this sound less intelligent) 

 To Do:
	~~Need to come up with a way to find and trap mad oblexes~~ Irrelevant, this is the player's problem to come up with a solution. Not mine.
		What if the house of a mad oblex is completely devoid of thought gossamers?
		If the ranchers only work on the main body, how would they go about finding it?
			Something about the hubris of oblexes. They fight as though they know they are invulnerable.
