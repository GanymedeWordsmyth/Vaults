**Step 1:** choose about 20 shops/POI's per town  
([http://arcana.wikidot.com/list-of-medieval-european-professions](http://arcana.wikidot.com/list-of-medieval-european-professions))
 
**Shops** (Choose one that the town is known for, the thing that the town was built around)  
Baker (if there's a baker, there would probably be a mill)  
Blacksmith  
Carpenter  
Chandler (candlemaker)  
Church (or other place of worship)  
Cobbler  
Farrier  
General Store/trader's post/Carter's stand (A carter is a traveling merchant, buying things that one town makes and selling them at a town that requires it)  
Graveyard  
Mews (Falconer. Something unexpected that gives the town character and more depth)  
Inn  
Leatherworker  
Mill (near the river)  
Potter  
Reeve's house (local constabulary)  
Stables (buy, rent horses)  
Tayler/clothes dyer  
Tanner  
Weaver  
Wheelwright (someone who makes and repairs wheels)
 
For high fantasy areas  
Fortune-teller (hermit, rarely visited)  
Wizard's tower (hermit, rarely visited)
 
The thing that the town is known for gets broken down into specific, specialized jobs. In this example, the town is known for its stables and horses. Therefore, it would have its own specific farrier (one who trims and shoes horses' hooves), instead of the blacksmith doing it. There would also be a tanner to "boil down" each part of a horse after it dies into other useful components, and a leatherworker using the hide made by the tanner.
 
The local constabulary is local to the region not to the town. The Shire Reeve is the peacekeeper who visits from town to town and needs a place to sleep.
 
**Step 2:** Populate with names  
"Gary Gygax's Extraordinary Book of Names," etc.  
Figure out the owner's names, their family's names, who's married to whom,  
Basic ages and personalities (for help, imagine which actor you'd cast for each NPC) of a few important NPCs that the PCs will run into  
Make sure you, the DM, can pronounce all the names.
 
**Step 3:** Draw the town

(Graph) paper and writing/drawing implement, photoshop, campaign cartographer

2. First thing to draw is the main landscape (if there's a mill, there's a river)
3. Draw the road, bridges, and other structures
4. Draw the shops/POI's
    
    1. The largest, more important buildings get drawn first (the town is known for its stables and inn, so draw those first and make them the largest)
    2. Any crossing (albeit a crossing of two roads, or a road and a river.) creates four quadrants, each of which would probably be dominated by one or another shop
    3. Then draw the shops that support the main shop (the farrier, blacksmith, leatherworker)
    4. Then draw the miscellaneous, generic shops
5. Draw remaining terrain (contour lines)
6. Draw trees and plants
7. Number the buildings/create a legend
8. Create a little history (where did some of the town's buildings come from)
 
**Step 4:** Make a local area  
**Step 5:** Make an adventure
