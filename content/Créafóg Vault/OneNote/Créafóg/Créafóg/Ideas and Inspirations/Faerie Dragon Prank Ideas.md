The dragon could ask to borrow money for the party for "something important" he/he should ask for small amounts at first. The dragon might say it is for orphans or something.  
At first the money seems to disappear. But the dragon keeps asking for larger amounts and seems to have more nice things, a little jewelry, a nice new wand, then eventually when the PCs loan him/her a real pile of money small they start noticing some high end magic gear appearing.  
The players will likely get mad and demand the money back, if the dragon is near his hoard she/he will gladly give it back. He/She explains the apparent wealth by describing investments in local business the local smithy doubled his business with a new furnace, the fletcher makes ten times as many arrow with the new chicken coop providing feathers and one of the orphans turned out to be a wealthy heir in hiding.  
The dragon only borrowed the money to attempt to measure the financial value of the friendship: "5,000 Gold Pieces! Thatâ€™s nothing to be ashamed of."
   

The dragon forges a note to summon a king (or some lesser local lord that the party listens to) elsewhere and forges correspondence from the lord to the lords underlings...  
Or even simpler if the familiar gains a few levels and access some kind of charm or mind control spell and used it on said lord...  
Now the stage is set for an epic quest doled out the rightful leaders of the land. All that is needed is the dragons motive, perhaps the meet of some beast is rumored to be tasty. Then just maybe, the local lord (or his forged note) might request the players find and slay such a beast and back its something or other (spine, eyeball, testes, ears, left pinky toenail) for a magical component to safe the realm.  
The party goes on said quest and they find glory, honor and loot. They return to a lord or king who has no recollection of ever sending them and explains such beasts are rare and under the protection of some auspicious group. Perhaps some magi guild, a local university studying the last 2 of its kind, druid PETA, The military for defense reasons or maybe the crown prince thinks they are majestic and just added them to the royal coat of arms. At this point the little dragon points out how tasty they are with barbecue sauce.  
This has all kinds of plot and continuity effects on the world, but never deprived players of gear and opened up the opportunity for a quest to fix the situation.
   

Rule #1: Don't be a Kender. Don't steal important gear. Don't replace potions with berry juice. Don't do anything that seriously inhibits someone's ability to function. That said, some ideas:  
1) Take your pick of hats, shoes, gloves, and other things people put on without thinking. Insert your preference of dead mice, rotten fruit, or other gross things.  
2) Waterskins. Fill with your choice of vinegar, ahem "bodily waste products," or potion of reduce person.  
3) Put stuff in annoying places, like clothes in a tree. Under no circumstances should this include vital gear like component pouches or weapons.  
4) You have magic. Mage hand goose someone. Silent image of a seductive dryad. Grease everything (except, again, things that are vital for adventuring).  
5) My personal April Fool's: switch the sugar and the salt. Works best with tea addicts around.  
You get the idea? Annoying, possibly gross, but not dangerous or actually crippling. Don't go pouring magical wite-out all over the Wizard's spellbook unless they are particularly forgiving or you really want to know a new dimension of pain (literally).

DESCRIPTION The foot openings of the left shoe leads to inner of the right shoe and vice versa. Upon mundane inspection it simply appears that the contour of the right shoe has the support and contour of the left and vice versa. If the spell wears off while shoes are worn the shoes harmlessly eject themselves from the wearers foot when it is next lifted from the ground or otherwise convenient and harmless.
 
Use a mix of ghost sound and ventriloquism to make the fighter think his sword is an intelligent magic item that speaks to him (but only when no-one else is around).  
Find three pigs. Paint the numbers '1', '2' and '4' on them. Grease them, and chase them into the nearest castle. For added effect, make them invisible for a short while.  
Use a combination of ghostly disguise and disguise self to look like the (shrunken) ghost of some famous dragon. Give the party a very silly quest and threaten to haunt them forever if they don't do as they're told. Keep giving sillier and sillier quests until someone works it out.  
Once the dragon is of high enough level (or if it gets hold of the relevant scroll) the combination of dream and disguise self offers a lot of potential.
 
"As you try to put on your boot, you realize that you picked it up the wrong boot. Yours is a few feet away from you. You go grab it and put it on. As you do, you try to pull it over your foot and it doesn't go. You look down and it's backwards. You turn it around as you put it on, it goes on just fine. You must have just been tired."
