This is not an exhaustive list, but other things you can spend the tokens on include: 

Guidelines for Spending DTs 
Pre-Approval and Transparency: Players should discuss with each other and the DM before spending tokens, ensuring the usage aligns with the narrative and gameplay balance. 
Limitations: Set clear guidelines on how often and in what situations tokens can be spent, maintaining the challenge and unpredictability of adventures. 
Narrative Justification: Encourage players to provide a narrative justification for their token expenditures, integrating their actions seamlessly into the story. 
Collaborative Storytelling: The DM may offer suggestions or alternatives for token spending that better suit the narrative or enhance the gaming experience. 

Boost Skill Checks Cost: 2 DT for a +1 bonus; 3 DT for a +3 bonus on a single skill check. 
Application: Before rolling a skill check, a player can spend DT to gain a temporary bonus, reflecting their character's preparedness or insight. 

Gain Advantage Cost: 3 DT to gain advantage on any one skill check, attack roll, or saving throw. 
Application: Represents the character leveraging their experience or a moment of inspiration to succeed in critical situations. 

Quick Recovery Cost: 2 DT to reduce the time needed for a short rest by half, or 5 DT to gain the benefits of a short rest immediately. 
Application: Useful for rapidly regaining strength in dungeon crawls or during time-sensitive missions. 

Resourceful Solution Cost: 4 DT to "create" a needed item or tool from available resources, subject to DM's approval based on plausibility. 
Application: Allows for creative problem-solving when missing crucial equipment, simulating the character's ability to improvise.

Tactical Edge in Combat Cost: 5 DT to gain a strategic advantage in combat, such as dictating the position of allies/enemies at the start, gaining insight into a creature's stat block, or creating an environmental advantage. 
Application: Reflects the character's tactical planning and battlefield awareness. 

Emergency Spell Slot Recovery Cost: Spellcasters can use Downtime Tokens to regain expended spell slots instantly, simulating a sudden insight, burst of energy, or divine favor. Spend an amount of Tokens equal to three times the desired spell slot to recover that slot. 
Application: In critical moments, allows spellcasters to regain expended spell slots, simulating a deep reserve of magical energy. This represents the character tapping into the knowledge and experiences they've accumulated during their downtime. 

Heroic Save Cost: 7 DT to automatically succeed on a death saving throw or to stabilize a dying character immediately. Normally, to stabilize a character without using spells requires a successful DC 10 medicine check. 
Application: Represents a surge of willpower or a desperate clutch at life, potentially turning the tide in dire situations. 

Narrative Influence Cost: Variable, starting from 5 DT , depending on the impact. 
Application: Players can spend DT to introduce minor narrative elements or gain small favors from NPCs, subject to DM approval. This simulates the character's connections, reputation, or previously unseen preparation.
