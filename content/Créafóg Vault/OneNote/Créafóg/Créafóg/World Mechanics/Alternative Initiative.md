Announce intention at top of initiative. Lowest goes first. If you want to attack/cast a spell, swap gear, move/interact, and use a bonus action, roll respective dice and do those things on the initiative count. I.e. if the rogue wants to bonus action hide and then attack with ranged, the player would roll a d4 and a d8. They would attack on the d4 number and hide on the d8 number.
