0.05≤Ψ<0.1
- Subtle Changes: Occasional headaches, fleeting moments of unease, or brief, disturbing dreams. Characters might have disadvantage on rolls directly related to concentration or mental resilience (DM rolls a d100, if the result is equal to or below the psi x100, then the player rolls with disadvantage)
- Narrative Cues: Small, almost imperceptible changes in behavior or perception, like momentarily forgetting familiar names or places.
- ~~Triggered effect: when [insert trigger happens], the creature behaves as though under the nathair's mischief spell for 1 minute. The creature rolls a d4 and makes the relevant save to avoid the effect. Additionally, a creature that fails this roll is under the effects of a see invisibility spell for 1 hour.~~
- Ethereal Whispers: Once per long rest, the character can attempt an Insight check against a DC determined by the equation above to gain a useful piece of information or a hint towards solving a puzzle, navigating social encounters, or even hints about an enemy's weakness. The downside is that focusing on these whispers can be mentally taxing, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws for 1 hour after using this insight.
