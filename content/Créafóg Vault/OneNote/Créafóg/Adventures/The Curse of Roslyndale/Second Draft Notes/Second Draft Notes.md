Use chatgpt to generate books in the Lackman libraries, especially the dangerous books
 
Quick notes:

- What happens if the party figures out and attempts to kill the mistress early? Maybe she flies into a rage, casting a dark shadow and the final boss fight begins. The time quickly shifts to not only night, but the villagers shift to their final undead form.
- I want to come up with specs for Cotton's Soul Retrieval spell. It needs stabilization, but with time and resources, that shouldn't be too difficult. Maybe the specifics of the spell aren't revealed until the stabilization is complete, since the end isn't specific. Also come up with the mechanics of stabilizing and finishing the spell, which should include studying anatomy and physiology (aka expertise in medicine, which Henry's research will teach them. Use the training ruleset.)
    
    - Something in me wants to say that this spell should only be able to target children
 
Notes I made in first draft (aka, quick glance)

- Page 2
    
    - First section needs a rewrite. I have noted that I need to correct the info.
    - Add a background description
    - Add more story hooks
- Should probably get rid of all the links. Or at least limit them. They're everywhere and making things look ugly
- Should items obtained at night stay in the party's inventory?
- Rewrite the Mistress' Final Route
- Should I make Day 474 only appear at night? Anything taken from anywhere else is mentioned as being stolen.
- "She lists off [the names of the party members]â€¦"
- Remove and replace the Playing Chess Win or Loss charts
- Provide description for the butler's office
- Expand the "Who was Diven" sidebar
- Wash Room and WC refers to a 1dX. Figure out which dice is balanced.
- Made a note to nerf the Mistress' drain ability and give it a bigger range
- Expand on "can do magic stuff"
- Expand the section "A Secret for the Curious and the Clever"
- Expand the section "What Next?"
- Appendices:
    
    - Provide better descriptions
    - Should I produce stats for Kairon? Does party have the opportunity to enlist their help? Maybe if they complete something to do with the Queen Milla?
    - Come up with residual hauntings ideas
    - Produce more books for Mr. Lackman's public and private libraries
    - Need stats for the wailer (based off the witch in the Left4Dead series)
    - Need backstory, combat strats, and loot for the Penitent Warrior. Also, need stats for the warrior's armor that will become available to the party if they defeat it.
    - Need more description for the Liberi Temporiae
    - Most of the "New Items" are actually not mine and are likely copyrighted
    - What are the side effects of the Expired Potion of Invisibility?
- Should probably replace the Nine Men's Morris image.
- Maps
    
    - Cemetery
    - Church (including basement)
