This orcish stronghold is the capital of Thadrinnor. It was named by Luthic, the Cave Mother, after the lush, green rolling hills on which it proudly stands. Gruumsh prefers to call it Gijaklod after the brutality displayed by his chosen few. [[Grutok the Brutal]] is the current commander of the stronghold.
## [[Granny Gretta Greenteeth]] and the Bear Women
Granny has infiltrated the Luthic women in Baloratukkin and is whispering in the ears of everyone in the stronghold. She claims to have had a vision from Luthic herself that the Gods are not happy with [[Grutok the Brutal]] and wants him to be overthrown. The first faction to destabilize and overthrow one of the human's major settlements (Fairfield, Port Aldshore, and Fort Strongwater, and one more that the humans don't yet know about) will have the favor of their God to overthrow [[Grutok the Brutal]].
