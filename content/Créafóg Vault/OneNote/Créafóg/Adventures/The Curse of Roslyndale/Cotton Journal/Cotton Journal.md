#### Entry 1: Foreboding Arrival  
"Upon this morn, I find myself treading the cobbled paths of Roslyndale, a world apart from the turbulent life I left behind. Mr. Heward Lackman, a beacon from days long past, has granted me sanctuary in these desperate times. His assurance of safety within this idyllic village offers some solace, yet a shadow of unease looms within me. I am keenly aware of the perils my presence could bring, for the relentless pursuit of those who hunt my kind knows no bounds. Each exchange with the villagers, while cordial on the surface, is tinged with the silent dread of a truth that lurks within me – a secret that, if exposed, could shatter this semblance of peace."
 
#### Entry 2: A Delicate Masquerade  
"Amid the rustic charm of Roslyndale, I navigate a delicate masquerade. Each day, as I mingle with its folk, I am reminded of the precarious nature of my situation. The fear of discovery lingers like a ghost at my shoulder, casting a subtle pall over the daily pleasantries. The villagers, with their guileless smiles and easy laughter, remain blissfully unaware of the storm that brews beneath my calm exterior. In their presence, I find both solace and sorrow, for hidden beneath my guise as a mere practitioner of the arcane is a truth far more perilous – a nature that, if revealed, could unleash a maelstrom upon this unsuspecting haven."
 
#### Entry 3: Meeting the Lackman Family  
"This day, I was graced with an introduction to the Lackman family, a household embodying the warmth and spirit of Roslyndale. Mistress Lackman, a figure of dignified poise, and her children, effervescent with youthful exuberance, welcomed me into their fold with open arms. The hearth of their home radiated a comfort and normalcy I had not felt in many a moon. Yet, amidst their laughter and kind words, a sense of guardedness took root within me. In the depths of their unsuspecting eyes, I glimpsed the potential for ruin should the truth of my sorcerous nature come to light. Thus, I donned an unseen mask, playing the part of the humble wizard, all the while cognizant of the perilous tightrope I walk – a man harboring a secret that, if unveiled, could unravel the very fabric of the peaceful life the Lackmans hold dear."
 
#### Entry 4: The Eyes of Innocence  
"Under the watchful gaze of young Silifrey, I have come to realize the depth of her perceptive abilities. Her innocent curiosity, unmarred by the prejudices of the world beyond, must see through the facade I so meticulously uphold. Each interaction with her is akin to a dance, one where I must artfully sidestep her probing questions and keen observations. Her intuition, though not yet fully understood by her youthful mind, poses a risk I had not anticipated. It is in the unguarded moments, the fleeting glances, where I see her puzzling over the inconsistencies in my story. I must tread carefully, for the insight of a child, and this one in particular, unfiltered and pure, could unwittingly unravel the tapestry of secrecy I have woven around myself."
 
#### Entry 5: Suspicions and Unspoken Truths  
"Recent days have brought a subtle yet unmistakable shift in the air, particularly in my interactions with Mistress Lackman. Her demeanor, once reflective of simple cordiality and blissful ignorance of my true nature, now carries a hint of guarded understanding. I cannot help but suspect that young Silifrey, in her innocence, may have unwittingly revealed my secret. The child, blessed with a keen intuition yet unaware of the gravity of such a revelation, could not have comprehended the peril it brings. Thus, I find myself in a delicate dance of uncertainty and suspicion, wondering if the Mistress truly knows of my sorcerous lineage. No words have been exchanged on the matter, yet in every silent acknowledgment, in every measured conversation, I sense the truth lurking just beneath the surface. The burden of this unconfirmed knowledge weighs heavily upon me, casting a shadow over the fragile sanctuary I have found in Roslyndale."
 
#### Entry 6: A Close Call and Silent Accord  
"Today, the shadows I've long feared crept into Roslyndale. An agent of the Sovereign Concordat, a witch hunter, arrived under the guise of mundane inquiries, seeking a suspected sorcerer. My heart raced as our paths crossed; his piercing gaze, like a hawk's, seemed to see through my every defense. The encounter was a razor's edge from disaster, but fate, it seems, had other plans.
 
Just as the witch hunter's suspicions neared confirmation, Mistress Lackman intervened, her timing as fortuitous as it was unexpected. With an air of casualness belying the gravity of the situation, she engaged the agent, her words weaving a protective shroud around my precarious position. Her deft conversation steered his suspicions astray, allowing me to remain concealed in plain sight.
 
During this heart-stopping exchange, an astonishing revelation unfolded. I discerned that the late Mr. Lackman had foreseen such a perilous eventuality. In his wisdom and foresight, he had ensconced powerful wards around me, designed to obfuscate my true nature. These wards, unbeknownst to me, had been my silent guardians, shielding me from the prying senses of the witch hunter.
 
The Mistress, through her subtle cues and veiled glances during the conversation, revealed her awareness of my sorcerous identity. Yet, in her actions, she extended an unspoken assurance of sanctuary. This silent accord between us, born amidst the clutches of danger, has bound our fates in a complex weave of secrecy and mutual reliance. The realization that both the late Mr. Lackman and now the Mistress have chosen to protect me leaves me in a state of profound gratitude and deepening resolve."
 
**Note: at this point he doesn't suspect indebtedness. Later, make sure he comments on his unforeseen debt.**
 
#### Entry 7: Rising Illness and Unveiled Ties  
"As a subtle ailment begins to weave its way through Roslyndale, concern mounts among the townsfolk. Today, Millie Kinsley, the innkeeper of The Wandering Flower, approached me with a mixture of worry and hope in her eyes. She implored me to use whatever magic I might possess to understand and possibly curb this burgeoning sickness. 'You may not be a healer, but perhaps your magic can offer some insight,' she said, her words betraying her knowledge of my true identity as a sorcerer in hiding.
 
This acknowledgment of my sorcerous nature was not met with fear or hostility but rather with a quiet trust, a testament to the bond I've unwittingly formed with the people of Roslyndale. In our conversation, Millie also revealed to me a fascinating aspect of the town's history. Mr. Heward Lackman, my benefactor, was once a member of the storied adventuring group known as the Grove. Alongside him were Gorren Ramski, the village chef known for his hearty meals and warm heart; Aranor Thalis, the steadfast jailor with a keen sense of justice; and Kairon, a figure of valor and sacrifice, memorialized by the statue in the town's fountain.
 
This revelation of Mr. Lackman's and his companions' past adventures adds a rich tapestry to the backdrop of Roslyndale. It paints a picture of a town woven together by the legacies of its heroes, both celebrated and unsung.
 
Compelled by Millie's request and moved by the trust she and others have placed in me, I resolved to do what I can. As I walked among the ailing, I felt a deep connection to this place that has become my refuge. The magic I possess, though not of the healing kind, may yet offer some insight into this mysterious illness.
 
Today has deepened my sense of belonging in Roslyndale, intertwining my fate with its residents. The intricate web of trust, secrets, and heroic pasts binds me ever more to the destiny of this town, urging me to stand with its people in their hour of need."
 
#### Entry 8: Grief and the Plague's Grip - Note: This is the first time Mr Cotton has called her by her first name, instead of the Mistress. Additionally, he doesn't even use the honorific, Mistress.  
#### Entry 8: The Children's Illness and a Desperate Search  
"Today, a pall of despair has fallen over Roslyndale, further darkened by news that the Lackman children, Silifrey, Kethra, and Branlyn, have succumbed to the mysterious illness afflicting the town. Witnessing Westra enveloped in such profound worry and fear has deeply moved me. I offered what words of comfort I could, but they seemed woefully inadequate in the face of a mother's distress. This turn of events has intensified my commitment to finding some form of treatment or relief.
 
Amidst this growing crisis, word has finally reached Roslyndale that the Bailen Council has issued a state of emergency in response to the plague. Their dispatches claim that this illness is resistant to traditional magical healing, a disheartening revelation that sheds light on why my previous attempts have been ineffective. The council’s reports speak of the ailment's stubborn resistance to the spells and incantations practiced by conventional mages.
 
Despite this daunting challenge, I find myself clinging to a ray of hope. My magic, intrinsic in nature and a part of my very essence, stands apart from the magic of study and invocation. I hold onto the belief that this unique aspect of my sorcery might just provide a critical edge against the illness’s resistance. It's a thin strand of hope, but in times as dire as these, even the thinnest strand can be a lifeline. With a renewed sense of purpose, I continue my research and experiments, seeking any means by which my innate connection to the arcane might offer a glimmer of hope against this relentless malady."
 
#### Entry 9: A Turn of Tides and Deepening Concerns  
"As the days pass in Roslyndale, the town witnesses a bittersweet divide in the fates of those afflicted by the illness. For many, the tides of sickness are receding, bringing with them the first signs of recovery and a cautious breath of relief. Yet, for others, the situation grows increasingly dire, with their conditions deteriorating at an alarming rate. Among these unfortunate souls are the Lackman children, whose worsening state casts a deepening shadow over the heart of Mistress Westra Evelynn Lackman and the entire town.
 
In this critical hour, I find myself stretched to my limits, offering what aid and comfort I can, though it feels akin to stemming a tide with mere handfuls of sand. My every waking moment is spent in relentless research and experimentation, seeking any strand of hope or hidden knowledge that might halt this descent into despair. The grim reality, however, is that my efforts may not suffice to bring them back from the brink. This thought haunts my every step, a specter whispering of impending loss and failure.
 
Despite these growing fears, I refuse to yield to despair. Each trial, each setback in my studies, serves only to steel my resolve. Yet, beneath this determined exterior, there lurks a gnawing concern – the possibility that my abilities, though considerable, might fall short in the face of this insidious malady. The prospect of failing the Lackman children, and by extension, the Mistress, weighs heavily upon me, a burden that grows with each passing hour of their continued decline."
 
#### Entry 10: Shadows of Grief and a Fracturing Mind  
"The specter of death continues its grim march through Roslyndale, each day marked by the loss of another soul succumbed to the relentless clutch of the illness. The town, once a haven of tranquility, now reels under the weight of these successive tragedies. Amidst this cascade of sorrow, the most heartrending blow was dealt – the passing of the Lackman children. First, we lost young Kethra, her light extinguishing too soon. Then, Branlyn followed, his youthful resilience faltering. And lastly, Silifrey, whose keen insight and innocence had once unwittingly revealed my secret, joined her siblings in eternal rest.
 
In the time I have spent in Roslyndale, I had come to regard these children with a fondness akin to that of a father. Their loss is a wound to my own soul, a grief so profound that under normal circumstances, it would keep me from the solace of my journal. Yet, tonight, I write, compelled by a pressing need to document a troubling change I have observed in Westra. Her sanity, it seems, is fraying at the edges, the fabric of her mind torn apart by the unbearable loss of her children.
 
There is a coldness in her gaze now when she looks upon me, a bitter accusation unspoken but palpably felt. Her words, once warm and kind, are now edged with a frost that chills me to the bone. I sense her blame directed towards me, as if my failure to save her children is a sin for which I must atone. The path ahead is murky, and I fear where it might lead. I find myself writing these words not just as a record of events, but as a premonition of darker days to come. 'I do not know where this is going, but I can already tell I am not going to like it.' The foreboding that taints these words is a storm cloud on my horizon, and I brace myself for the tempest it portends."
 
#### Entry 11: A Fateful Conversation and a Dangerous Promise  
"Tonight, within the dimly lit confines of The Wandering Flower tavern, Westra and I found ourselves sharing a drink, united in our grief. The tavern's usual bustle seemed a world away as we reminisced about her children, their laughter and their antics that once filled the Lackman household with joy. Our conversation, meandering through the valleys of memory, unexpectedly veered into the realm of the arcane. The topics ebbed and flowed, touching upon the mysteries of life and death.
 
In a moment marred by the haze of sorrow and wine, I made a tangential remark that one could, in theory, bring back the departed. Westra, her interest piqued, pressed me for details. My tongue, loosened by inebriation, let slip a second, more perilous thought – that given time and resources, I might find a way to perform such a resurrection, despite the inherent dangers. It was more of a theoretical musing than a serious proposition, but to Westra, my words were a beacon of hope in her sea of despair.
 
Sensing an opportunity, she offered me access to not only the Lackman Public Library but also to Heward's private collection of arcane knowledge. My heart leaped at the prospect. Heward Lackman, a man whose prowess in the magical arts I had long admired from afar, had accumulated a wealth of knowledge that could prove invaluable. In my excitement, I failed to see the potential pitfalls of this path. 'Absolutely!' I exclaimed, blinded by my own hubris – a failing that has often been my downfall.
 
As our conversation drew to a close, I suggested that the local priest cast a spell called 'gentle repose' on her children's bodies every ten days to preserve them. This would buy me time to delve into Heward's research and develop a safe and effective ritual. A part of me trembled at the magnitude of what I was undertaking. What started as a shared moment of mourning had spiraled into a commitment fraught with uncertainty and danger. As I left the tavern, the weight of our conversation and the promise I had made hung heavily upon me, a chain of hope and dread that I had unwittingly shackled myself with."
 
#### Entry 12: The Burden of Expectations and Inherent Limitations  
"Six months have elapsed since I last penned my thoughts in this journal. The task I have undertaken, to resurrect the Lackman children, has consumed every waking moment, leaving no room for personal reflections. Westra's presence has become a constant in my life, her urgency a tide that ebbs and flows with my progress – or lack thereof. Each time she inquires about the ritual, my response remains the same: 'Magic does not work swiftly.' This seems to pacify her impatience, but I sense it is a temporary reprieve.
 
The hurdles before me are daunting. The first is the sheer magnitude of the magic required for such a feat. The spells and rituals necessary to bring back the dead are far beyond my current capabilities. I am like a novice attempting to scale a peak that only the most seasoned of climbers could conquer. I delve into Heward's tomes and scrolls, seeking any hint or secret that could elevate my abilities to the required level, but the path is steep and fraught with uncertainty.
 
The second, and perhaps more insurmountable challenge, lies in the very nature of my sorcery. My innate magical abilities, derived from a source unique to my being, do not naturally align with the type of magic required for resurrection. It is akin to a bard endeavoring to decipher the complex incantations of a high wizard – the knowledge is not only foreign but seemingly inaccessible. I am venturing into uncharted territory, seeking to harness and adapt powers that, by all accounts, should be beyond my reach.
 
The risk of catastrophic spell failure looms over this endeavor like a dark cloud. If I do not find a way to overcome both my limitations and the constraints of my intrinsic magic, the consequences could be dire. This knowledge weighs heavily on my mind, a constant reminder of the delicate balance I must strike between the fervent hope of a grieving mother and the cold, unyielding laws of magic."
 
#### Entry 13: On the Cusp of Discovery and Growing Fears  
"A full season has passed since my last entry, and the winds of change have brought with them a glimmer of hope in my daunting quest. My studies in human anatomy and physiology have borne fruit; I now possess a detailed understanding of the bodily organs and their myriad functions. This knowledge is a crucial piece in the intricate puzzle I am attempting to solve. My current endeavor is to find an animal that has succumbed to the same malady that took the villagers and the Lackman children. If I can procure such a specimen, it may allow me to reverse-engineer the disease, bringing me one step closer to the resurrection I seek.
 
For the moment, Westra has granted me a semblance of space, a respite that is both surprising and welcome. However, I am under no illusion that this reprieve will be lasting. Her patience, though momentarily stayed, is like a candle burning at both ends, and I fear it will not be long before her demands for progress resume with renewed fervor.
 
As the days pass, it becomes increasingly evident that Westra's sanity is unraveling, a thread slowly pulled loose by grief and desperation. With each unraveling strand, a piece of her humanity seems to fade into the shadows. The transformation is subtle yet unmistakable, and it fills me with a sense of foreboding. I find myself increasingly apprehensive about the lengths to which she may go in the coming days. Her descent into madness is a journey I am powerless to halt, and I fear what desperate measures she might resort to as her grip on reality continues to weaken.
 
In this time of tentative progress and uneasy calm, I am acutely aware of the delicate balance I must maintain. The task before me is monumental, not merely in its technical complexity but in its potential repercussions on Westra's fragile state of mind. As I continue my research, the shadow of her looming instability is ever-present, a dark cloud over what should be a time of focused study and hopeful exploration."
 
#### Entry 14: A Breakthrough in the Midst of Despair  
"Another season has turned its page in Roslyndale, bringing with it both despair and a flicker of hope. Approximately a month after my last entry, fortune, or perhaps fate, led me to a cat afflicted with the very malady that claimed the Lackman children. With a sense of urgency, I embarked upon a meticulous study of the creature in its final hours, documenting each symptom and change with painstaking detail. My observations continued unabated as the poor beast succumbed to the illness, marking the beginning of a more intensive phase of experimentation.
 
In the months that followed, the small, lifeless form of the cat became the focus of my relentless efforts. Employing the spell of 'gentle repose' to preserve its body, I delved into the depths of my arcane knowledge, seeking to undo the ravages wrought by the disease. It was a task that consumed me, my every waking moment dedicated to reversing the effects of this insidious affliction.
 
Then, in a moment that I can only describe as a triumph against the shadows of despair, the cat's tail twitched of its own accord. That singular, independent movement was a beacon in the darkness, a sign that I was indeed moving in the right direction. The breakthrough filled me with a surge of hope and determination, a much-needed balm to the weary soul.
 
Now, on the cusp of stabilizing the spell, I stand at the threshold of a new and daunting phase: human testing. The knowledge that I am nearing the point where I can attempt to apply this magic to the Lackman children is both exhilarating and terrifying. The path ahead is fraught with unknowns, but the possibility of restoring life where it was once extinguished propels me forward.
 
As I prepare for this next crucial step, I am mindful of the immense responsibility that rests upon my shoulders. The success of this endeavor could mean the difference between eternal grief and miraculous reunion for Westra. Yet, the weight of this responsibility is tempered by the knowledge that with each passing day, her grasp on reality further loosens, adding an urgency to my work that cannot be ignored. In the quiet moments, I ponder the consequences of failure, not only in terms of the arcane but also in what it might mean for Westra's already fragile state of mind."
 
#### Entry 15: A Precipice of Hope and Ethical Dilemmas  
"Less than a month has passed since my last entry, and in this brief span of time, my research has taken an unexpected leap forward. The spell, initially unstable and unpredictable in its effects on animals, has begun to exhibit a remarkable adaptability across various species. From the smallest of birds to the cold-blooded reptiles, the magic seems to almost stabilize itself, bending and weaving through the intricate tapestry of life in ways I had not anticipated.
 
With this newfound stability in animal subjects, I stand on the brink of venturing into human trials. The prospect fills me with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. However, in a moment of unbridled enthusiasm and, I must confess, a touch of hubris, I revealed to Westra that I have developed a working prototype. The reaction in her eyes was akin to a dying flame suddenly rekindled - a mixture of hope and a burning intensity that I had not seen in her for some time.
 
Her reaction, while initially heartening, quickly turned to a pressure I was not prepared for. She urged me to use the prototype immediately, her desperation palpable. Fortunately, I managed to convince her of the significant risks still associated with using this spell on humans. The likelihood of catastrophic failure remains high, a fact that, for the moment, has stayed her insistence.
 
As the illness continues its grim hold on the children of Roslyndale, I am painfully aware that I will not lack for test subjects. This thought alone is a horrifying reflection of the person I have become in the midst of this crisis. To view these ailing children as mere subjects for my arcane experiments is a stark deviation from the man I once was. This realization casts a shadow over my soul, a darkness that seems to grow with each passing day.
 
I end this entry with a heavy heart and a mind burdened by ethical quandaries. The path I walk is fraught with moral peril, each step a reminder of the fine line between salvation and damnation. I long for the day when this nightmare is over, when the weight of these decisions is lifted from my shoulders, and the children of Roslyndale can once again embrace the light of life."
 
#### Entry 16: Desperation and Ultimatums  
"Another season has passed in Roslyndale, and with it, the last vestiges of Westra's patience have evaporated. In a confrontation that still leaves my hands trembling as I write, she declared her ultimatum with a cold, steely resolve. No longer willing to wait, she threatened to expose my true identity to the Sovereign Concordat. The mere thought of falling into the hands of the Concordat, who would undoubtedly have their own form of justice for a rogue sorcerer like myself, sends chills down my spine.
 
Her threat was cunningly crafted, leaving her the role of the innocent victim, an unsuspecting villager who had unwittingly harbored a sorcerer. The realization of her willingness to sacrifice me to save herself was both enraging and disheartening. It served as a stark reminder of how desperation can twist even the most kind-hearted souls into unrecognizable forms.
 
It has been only a month and a half since I achieved partial stabilization of the prototype ritual. My progress, while significant in the realm of animal resurrection, pales in comparison to the complexities of human life. The simple anatomies of animals are far easier to mend with magic than the intricate tapestry of the human body. Though I can now bring back animals without immediately destroying their bodies, the leap to human resurrection remains a daunting chasm.
 
The experiments have been grueling, with some successes overshadowed by harrowing failures. There have been instances where the bodies were not just left lifeless but were catastrophically eviscerated by the unstable forces at play. The horror of these failures weighs heavily on me, a constant reminder of the perilous nature of this endeavor.
 
Westra's impatience and her chilling ultimatum have added a layer of urgency and fear to my work. The knowledge that any further delay could result in my exposure to the Concordat, coupled with the still-unsolved complexities of human resurrection, has left me in a state of heightened anxiety. The stakes have never been higher, and the path forward never more fraught with peril. As I close this entry, I cannot help but feel trapped in a relentless cycle of desperation and danger, with each experiment a race against time and the looming threat of betrayal."
 
#### Entry 17: The Final Gamble  
"Ten days have passed since the ultimatum, and tonight marks the culmination of all my efforts and fears. Westra came to me this evening, her resolve hardened, brandishing papers meticulously prepared to deliver me into the hands of the Concordat. The documents were crafted with chilling precision, absolving her of any complicity in harboring a sorcerer. The cold finality in her eyes as she presented them left no room for doubt – she is resolute in her decision.
 
In these desperate hours, however, a glimmer of hope has emerged. I have managed to further stabilize the prototype, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic failure. The progress brings a measure of relief, albeit a small one, in the face of the daunting task ahead. The odds are still perilously stacked against us, but the prospect of success, however slim, offers a faint beacon of hope in this darkest of nights.
 
We have agreed to commence the ritual an hour past midnight. The stillness of the late hour, I hope, will lend an added layer of concentration and focus required for such a delicate and dangerous endeavor. My hands are steady, but my heart is a tumult of anxiety and anticipation. The weight of this moment, the culmination of many seasons of toil, fear, and ethical quandaries, rests heavily upon my shoulders.
 
As I pen this final entry, the reality of what I am about to undertake sets in. This is more than a mere test of my magical abilities; it is a gamble with the highest stakes imaginable. The lives of the Lackman children, my own fate, and perhaps the very soul of Roslyndale hang in the balance.
 
I ask for no divine intervention, nor do I expect any. But if there is any fortune left in this world for a man who has walked the line between life and death, let it find me tonight. Wish me luck."
