It's been established that Millie was part of an adventuring party. What if the whole party (that survived) settled down in Roslyndale? How cool would that be?! A retired 14th level party that the adventurers may or may not go up against one by one. Each capable of holding their own against a 5th level party, but will likely not kill them.
 
Members of The Grove:  
Millie Kinsley, the Wandering Flower - Open Fist Monk  
Chef Gorren Ramski, the Oaken Tansy (Strength, hostility) - Desert Storm Herald Barbarian  
~~Henry Cotton, the White Chrysanthemum (Truth) - Divination Wizard - High enough level to cast the~~ _resurrection_ ~~and~~ _raise dead_ ~~spells, but not the right class to do so. Instead, he has to learn the secrets of a god. Hence why it failed so badly.~~  
Aranor Thalis, the Crimson Belladonna (Silence, Mourning) - female elf thief - Captain of the Roslyndale guard, now known as Mrs. Ilene Pratcher. Her ears were cut as a punishment before she became an adventurer  
Kairon, the Violet Snapdragon (Loyalty, Deception) - deceased forked tongue tiefling bard

Most adventurers who survive their campaigns tend to, at some point, choose a location to settle down with their spoils and live comfortably for the rest of their days. Some settle alone, some as a team. This is exactly how The Grove found themselves in the small village of Roslyndale.  
Millie is likely going to be the first member the party meets as she, with her husband, runs the village inn, The Wandering Flower, thusly named because that was her title while an adventurer. Each member had a floral title that described that member as listed below.
