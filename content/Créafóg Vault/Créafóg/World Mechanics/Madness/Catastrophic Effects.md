Ψ=1.0
- Complete Fracture: The character's soul fractures entirely, leading to a permanent state of madness or becoming a lost soul wandering the Ethereal Plane. This might necessitate a powerful ritual, divine intervention, or a significant quest to restore them, if at all possible.
- Gameplay Impact: At this stage, characters are likely unplayable until significant narrative measures are taken to address their condition. This could serve as a critical plot point or campaign arc.
- Soul Sundering
	- Effect Description: The character’s soul reaches a breaking point, teetering on the edge of being permanently sundered. This moment of crisis unlocks the raw, unbridled essence of their soul’s power, granting them near-godlike abilities for a brief moment.
	- Benefit: For a single encounter or scene, the character draws power from the ethereal plane itself and gains the ability to cast spells without expending spell slots, automatically succeeds on all saving throws, and can perform two actions on their turn. They can also see into both the border and deep ethereal plane, allowing them to perceive any hidden or invisible entities and to interact with multiple planes at once.
	- Downside: Immediately after this surge of power, the character collapses into a state of soul shock. Their Psi is permanently set at 1.0, and they suffer severe consequences: they lose the ability to cast spells, suffer permanent disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws, and cannot perceive or interact with the Ethereal Plane. The character’s soul is so fractured that they are on the brink of ceasing to exist as a coherent entity, risking becoming an ethereal wraith or being lost to the planes forever.

- Redemption or Ruin
	- Path to Redemption: At this catastrophic juncture, a quest or significant narrative arc can be introduced for the possibility of soul restoration. This could involve a legendary ritual, divine intervention, a pact with a powerful entity, or a journey to a place where the fabric of reality can be rewoven. Success doesn’t fully revert the character to their former state but stabilizes their Psi, removing the permanent disadvantages while retaining some marks of their ordeal as reminders of their journey. The character stays in this state until their psi becomes 0. At which point, the character can slowly begin to slowly regain their former abilities.
	- Risk of Ruin: Failure to restore the soul results in the character’s transformation into an ethereal wraith, effectively removing them from play. This outcome serves as a narrative culmination of their arc, potentially transforming them into an NPC ally, adversary, or a part of the campaign’s lore. The character has 1 year to reset their psi to 0.

- Implementing the Catastrophic Tier
	- Narrative Weight: This tier should feel like a climactic moment in the character’s story, heavily influenced by their choices, sacrifices, and the bonds they’ve formed throughout the campaign.
	- Player Agency: While the consequences are severe, ensure players are fully aware of the stakes and have the agency to seek redemption or embrace their character’s fate. This tier offers a moment of ultimate transformation and should be approached with the player’s consent and involvement in shaping the outcome.
	- Gameplay Balance: The catastrophic tier effects are dramatic and game-changing. Balance them within your campaign to ensure they enhance the story without overshadowing the contributions of other characters.
Reaching Psi 1.0 and facing "Soul Sundering" is a profound moment that should be carefully woven into the tapestry of your campaign, offering a blend of ultimate power, dire risk, and the potential for either redemption or ruin. This not only serves as a testament to the dangers of delving too deep into the realms of soul magic but also highlights the themes of sacrifice, resilience, and the quest for understanding beyond the boundaries of known reality.
