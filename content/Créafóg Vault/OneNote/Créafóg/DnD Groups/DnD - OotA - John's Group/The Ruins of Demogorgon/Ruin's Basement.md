Box text:  
A large stone statue sits in a throne. In front of the statue is a table on which is a copper chalice with silver filigree in the front left corner and a silver ewer sitting just to the left of that, facing the chalice. In the center of the table sitting on an embroidered silken handkerchief is 600cp. Sitting next to the statue is a small chest **[containing** **3000sp, 2100gp, and 60pp].**  
A successful DC14 Investigation shows the characters that the chest is trapped. A DC14 DEX check with thieves tools disarms the trap. The one who opens the chest without the key is subject to sleep if they fail their saving throw. DC14: If failed, the chest releases a puff of green smoke and the subject falls asleep and takes 2d10 poison damage.
 
The madness of the demon lords has slowly seeped into the temple bringing to life some of the plant life. Defacing the temple activates these plants, which remember the pain of the great war that sunk the temple. The dead tree outside comes to life (use the treant stat block). When confronted, it summons two awakened shrubs.
