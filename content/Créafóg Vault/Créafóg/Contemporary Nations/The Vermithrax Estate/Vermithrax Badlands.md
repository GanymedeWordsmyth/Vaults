The library is its own entity and has its own mission types, most of which includes information gathering and retrieval.  
  
How this will work: low effort, high reward  
The players group themselves and each group then choose a mission. Then a DM chooses which mission they will run and either crafts or generates a short, 3 to 4 hour session.  
  
The missions will have listed loot, but more loot will be found along the way. Loot includes artwork, gems, furniture, etc.  
  
Each character will have a room that can be decorated with any loot recvd on a mission.  
  
Then someone chronicals the mission in a debriefing in the discord. Characters are given incentives to being the chronicler. If no one wants to be the chronicler, then one is "appointed to them" aka the DM is the chronicler. I would prefer this to be from the perspective of the players though. If a DM is a chronicler, it should be notes in the chronicals channel (as an appointed chronicler).
