**Purple mahogany wood pieces**  
**Ash wood pieces**  
However many points the PC lost or won by gets added to a d20 roll (to a max of +N) to see which boon or curse they get. Keep in mind...  
This blocks off the first few numbers so make them more mild  
This also makes it more likely to roll a high number each way, so make them more extreme.
   

King  
Queen boon  
Freedom of movement spell  
Bishop boon  
Revivify once then crumbles. Casting it from this piece doesn't require the costly material component. If the holder of the bishop dies, the holder can activate the spell as a reaction after the range is taken but in the instant before the holder dies targeting the holder.

Chairs and couches are placed strategically through the room.  
Two pedestals are situated on either side of the room between the seats holding some magic items  
A carved chess table sits in the center of the room setup for play. **If the characters approach the chess table, or are every within 5 feet of it, white moves king's pawn to D4**

- If none of the characters sit and play, have everyone make a DC15 Wisdom save. Of the ones that failed, the one that rolled the lowest result is compelled to play until the sun rises. Everyone else that failed is incapacitated as they are compelled to watch captivatedly. Remember: every hour in the manor hour saps energy from the players. Roll against exhaustion.
- Have the character thatâ€™s playing roll 4 DC16 Intelligence checks. If they end the game with 3 or more successes, they've won the game, on 2 successes, there was a stalemate, and less than 2 successes and they lost the game.
- During the time it was used frequently, it was merely an enchanted board to serve as practice with different difficulty settings in the house of a powerful wizard. Something bad happened to that house and that wizard (well to the whole village, really, but that's another story), and because of an unrelated spell failure and having been set on the most advanced setting before everything went down, the board has indeed gained sentience.

If the character won: May take a pawn (or other piece), which does something cool  
If there was a stalemate: make a higher DC wis save or replay  
If the character lost:

King  
Queen  
Knight  
Bishop - illusion  
Rook  
Pawn
 
Pawns may be fought with any combat ability. To beat a rook, one needs perseverance: Con checks to resist the hammering attacks, high-damage attacks to defeat their damage resistance. To combat a knight, those elusive bastards, you need Wisdom rolls to know where they'll be, and Dex rolls to actually hit them.  
Bishops are indirect and confusing. Int rolls to see through their illusions, and Wisdom checks to counter their honeyed words in your mind. Queens are a force of nature. You take penalties to all of your rolls until she is defeated. The King is almost an afterthought, though he can summon any of his remaining forces, one at a time, to face you.  
If you are a Pawn, you get a +1 to Con rolls.  
If you're a Rook, add 4 to your armor.  
Knights get +1 Dex.  
Bishops +1 Wis and the ability to see through illusions.  
If you're currently the Queen, choose two stats the get +1 for the duartion of the fight.  
If you're the King, you can summon your surviving pieces and fight off your attacker.
 
A former general had a full chess set of figurines of wondrous power. The pawns were ravens he could use to communicate across the country. The rooks were adamantine towers. The knights were pegasi and nightmares.
