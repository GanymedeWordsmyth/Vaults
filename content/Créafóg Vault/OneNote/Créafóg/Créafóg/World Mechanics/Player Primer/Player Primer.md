Happy 3 years!! (started on 10 June 2017)
 
Baile (BAL-yeh)  
Welcome to the region of Baile during the Age of the Dawn of Man. For many, many millennia, the Mundane World has been home to a vast number of humanoid races: Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, and Dragonkin, to name a few. Throughout early history, most of these races have seen humans as nothing more than intelligent animals to be used in labor and breeding, as humans seem to be able to do so with any race, creating crossbreeds that last longer and are more durable than both halves individually.
 
Within the last six centuries the humans have taken a stand against this slavery, with the help of the elves and dwarves, who never saw fit to enslave them in the first place. The elves were certain humans were far too gifted with the knowledge of the Weave to be slaves and the dwarves, by the power of Moradin, oppose slavery wherever they see it. Those under the care of the Highborn Elves learned to perform magic through long hours of study and sheer power of will. These became the first human wizards. Those under the guidance of the Woodland Elves were taught the chaotic ebb and flow of nature and became the first human druids and rangers. The dwarves gifted them with the knowledge of masonry and taught them the ability to connect with the divine. These became the first clerics and paladins. Over time it has been seen that humans have a natural aptitude for magic, both arcane and divine, to the point that they are able to innately sense when a magical presence is near.
 
After the Great War, the humans were given 500 years of sanctuary to make a name for themselves. That 500 years is now over and the other races want back their slaves.
 
People know that magic exists, but only a few know how to correctly access it.
 
The four regions were named after the four Generals at the head of the Saoirse.
 
Important human class information:  
Druids:  
A druid's grotto is in a pocket dimension of the astral plane, hence why they are so difficult to find. Druids are highly revered spell casters and as such are commonly seen in the court of most high ranking officials and nobility.  
Wizards: (Saoi describes a wise and learned person)  
Saois (SEEs) are the researchers and scientists that push development forward. These are commonly seen sitting next to high nobility.  
Clerics:  
In their study, some humans saw the Weave as a way to commune with their deities. Those who have successfully done so have become clerics. These humans carry out day to day chores of their respective deities.  
Paladins: (Misneach means courage and hope)  
Certain clerics have taken it on themselves to spread the word of their particular deities, becoming misneach (MISH-nock). The Misneach are seen as knights and enforcers of the laws of man. The Misneach and Centaurs often have a relative peace so they can maintain balance between civilization and nature, as Centaurs are the keepers of the chaotic element of nature.  
Bards: (Scéal means storyteller; Ceol means music, song, and vigor)  
Those that have figured out how to infuse their words and songs with the Weave have become scéal (shkayle) and ceols (kyol), respectively. They are responsible for spreading the words of new laws and other news. What they sing is believed unquestioningly as Bards tend to have unwavering morals.  
Sorcerers:  
Just before the third attempt to escape enslavement completely, the human druids and wizards worked together tirelessly to create a human infused with the power of the Weave. Three centuries it took to finally create such a being. This being was called a sorcerer, named after the elven word sorcer, meaning infusion. Sorcerers that were created and infused with the forces of nature are Wild Mages. The wizards and druids had also found a way to infuse humans with the Weave through the use of Dragon blood, opening up the Draconic Bloodline. Once created, sorcerers were the keystone in the humans gaining their independence from the oppressive races. Now that the war for independence is over, creation of sorcerers is no longer necessary. Modern sorcerers are now seen as abominations and are feared for their innate ability to pull at the threads of the Weave.  
Misc:  
There are also those who have been able to use the Weave for their own ends and have split off from the original classes. All classes have a mix of druidic and wizardly influences.
 
Eldritch Knights:  
Elves that roam the human regions looking to weed out those who are looking to cause trouble for the humans. They do not get involved in human affairs but they may stop a non human for simple questioning if they feel the need. Other races exist in the ranks of the Eldritch Knights, but those individuals are very few and have shown extraordinary potential for combat and magic.
 
Human reactions…

- to tieflings:
- To dragonborn:
- To half-orcs

Word has spread from town to town that death and destruction follows in the wake of a the demon spawn known as tieflings. If there is a tiefling in your town, it's time to move, far, far away.  
During the time of the Saoirse (SEER-sha), the deities, themselves, had come down in the form of shimmering humans of different metallic colors. They, along with the elves and a few other races helped to fight off the dragons and the humanoid kin of various colors that were enslaving the human race. Since the time of the great war, these chromatic dragons and dragonkin were fought off and are largely believed to have been destroyed entirely.
