To note: Instead of the abilities being based on the characters' levels, have it based on the size of their aether pool

Aether pool size = base pool + stat modifier x level + soulbond strength x ( milestone bonuses + feature/trait bonuses )
	Base pool: 10
	Stat modifiers
		Melee weapons, arm and hand armor: stat mod is Strength
		Finesse and ranged weapons, leg and foot armor: stat mod is Dexterity
		Head and Chest armor: stat mod is Constitution
		Clothing: stat mod is spellcasting mod
	Milestone bonuses:
		The bonus gained from reaching certain milestones with the item. Effectively, the more the character uses and actively bonds with the item, the higher this bonus is. These are awarded by the DM for things such as acting in accordance with the item's desires, even at the detriment of the character, questing for deeper connections, etc. Bonding to an item automatically grants a +1.
	Features/trait bonuses:
		Certain features and traits can deepen the connect between a character and its bonded item.
	Soulbond strength:
		A number representing the strength between the character and the item. 
			Creation (+5). If the character created the item, they are granted +5. 
			Heritage (+2 per generation). If the item is a family heirloom from the character's family, add 2 for each generation it was passed through. 
			Gift (+1). Add 1 if the item was a gift. 
			Previous bonds (-2 per item). If this item is not the first item the character has bonded to, subtract 2 for each item the character has previously bonded to. 
			Rebonding (-3). Subtract an extra 3 if the character rebonds with a previously bonded item. 
			Time bonded (see below):
				Initial Years:
					+5 after being bonded with the item for 1 year
					+4 after 2 years
					+3 after 3 years
					+2 after 4 years
					+1 after 5 years
				Extended years:
					+1 after being bonded for one decade
					+2 after being bonded for two decades
					+3 after three decades
					And so forth ag nauseum

Soul-bonded items are sentient items with their own quirks and personalities. Each item also has its own benefits and complications tables. When a character finds a soulbond item, the character must persuade the item to bond with them. The character cannot innately sense the item's alignment, mental ability scores, nor its abilities.

Soul-bonded items grow and evolve as the wielder bonds with the item (aether pool grows). Characters can only have one soul-bonded item. Soul-bonded items have two types of abilities: activation and passive. Passive abilities are always active. Activation abilities require soul shards to activate. Characters have a pool of soul shards that they can safely use called their aether pool. Character can use more soul shards than are in this pool. When a character uses more soul shards in their aether pool, roll 1d6, 1d8, add the results together, and consult the table below.

Whenever a character acts against the goals and desires of the item, the player rolls 1d100. If the roll is lower than the item's corruption percentage plus the excess shards used to activate an ability over the aether pool, the character makes a {contested roll/saving throw} or be possessed by the item.
Possession. The target's soul is shunted to the border ethereal and loses control of its body. The item now controls the body. The item can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, as the item's consciousness is now inside the body and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and its passive abilities. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the item ends it as a bonus action, or the possession is forcefully ended by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the character is no longer incapacitated and regains control of its body.
While on the border ethereal, the target can still communicate with its body and therefore the item that controls its body. The target can also try to deceive, intimidate, or persuade the item to relinquish control back to the target. If successful, the item willingly returns control to the target.

Roll 1d6+1d8 on the following table for every {5} points used over the safe maximum.
	1. Null
	2. The item attempts to possess the user
	3. Superior corruption: 3d8
	4. The item attempts to greatly corrupt the character. {Saving throw/contested roll}. If the roll fails, the item increases the corruption by 2d6/1d12%
	5. The item attempts to corrupt the character. {Saving throw/contested roll}. If the roll fails, the item increases the corruption over the character by 1d{6}%
	6. The desired ability fails to activate
	7. The ability activates with complications (see the item's complication table)
	8. The ability activates without complications
	9. The ability activates with an extra benefit (see the item's benefits table)
	10. The character reduces their corruption by 1d{6}%
	11. The character greatly reduces their corruption by {2d6/1d12}%
	12. Superior reduction: 3d8
	13. The character is immune to the next time the item would attempt to possess them.
	14. Aetheric Echo: The character triggers a latent echo within the Aether Pool. The next time they use an ability powered by Soul Shards, it resonates with the echo, causing one of the following random effects (roll a d4):
		i. Temporal Shift: The character gains a brief glimpse of the future, giving them advantage on their next initiative roll.
		ii. Spectral Duplicate: An illusory double of the character appears for 1 minute, distracting enemies and granting the character advantage on their next attack roll
		iii. Aetheric Feedback: The character chooses a die of any denomination and experiences a surge of raw aether, taking 1 die of psychic damage that they chose but gaining a temporary boost of 1 chosen die to their attack bonus or spell save DC for 10 minutes.
		iv. Mystic Revelation: The character taps into the collective consciousness of the Aether Pool, gaining a clue or hint from the DM about a current quest or puzzle.
