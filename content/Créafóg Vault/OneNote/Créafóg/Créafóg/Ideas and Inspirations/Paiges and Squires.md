Level: 1/4  
Level: 1/2  
Level: 1 (NPC)

Pages and squires level up whenever the character levels up.  
Each time a page levels up, they get to add one point to spend on their ability scores as well as a point towards one of the following

- Defensive: +1AC and +1HP
- Aggressive: +1 atk bonus
- Studious: +1 skill proficiency. Pages and squires use the PC's proficiency bonus

Once they have reached level 1, they themselves become a knight, take on a PC class of their own and are sent off on their own to become an ally.
