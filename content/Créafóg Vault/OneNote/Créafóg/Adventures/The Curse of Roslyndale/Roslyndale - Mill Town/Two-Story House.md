**Let them explore and investigate the first floor. Moving through the left door to the staircase triggers the residual haunting.**
 
You walk into first floor of this two story house. The interior is in disarray. The floor beneath you is decayed and splintering. To your right you see a broken dining table with some chairs around it, one of which is also broken. Looking closer, you swear you can see someone sitting at the table but once you readjust your eyes, there's nothing there. A case on the left holds a few personal affects of the owners and some toys for an infant. On the back wall are two doors framing a hearth. For Allanon and Cleetuhs, a strong smell of ozone hits you as you walk in as though running right into a wall.
 
The door on the right leads to a pantry with food long since rotted and withered.
 
Inspecting the hearth:  
Warm smoke rises from the cauldron in the cold hearth. When you look in to see further, the floorboards above you creak under someone's weight as someone walks across the floor humming a lullaby, soft, feminine. You look up and see a completely new and vibrant ceiling that is very well taken care of, light from the hearth fire dancing off the crossbeams. When you look back to the hearth, you see the bottom of a cold and dark cauldron.
 
As you touch the left side door give me a perception check **[DC10]** Those that pass glance back and you see a bear of a man, broad shoulders the size of a barn wearing a typical farmer's outfit sitting at the table horrifically stuffing his face his back facing you. Food, drink, and slobber falls from his mouth as he stuffs himself more and more. What do you do? **The man ignores the party if they call out to him or go anywhere in the house except for the following. Read the following if they approach him or the staircase:**  
The man slowly turns his head in your direction, mouth full of rotten food falling out and drink spilling out of his throat. A large glob of slobber forms out of the corner of his mouth and as it falls to the floor, the man lunges for you all. Roll a Wisdom saving throw **[DC 15 or be aged 1d4x10 years]**. Those that failed roll a d4
 
**Play this out to it's completion**
 
You open the door and behind it is a decrepit staircase leading up.
 
When you reach the top landing, there you are met with a door. What do you do?  
You enter the room, moonlight shining through the fog casting deep, dark shadows throughout. You see a chamber pot and wash basin in the far corner to your right. In the other corner is a turning wheel with broken down cotton attacked. A side table sits next to a bed in front of you. The sheets and blankets are old and decayed. In the bed rests two leathery dead corpses. To the right of the bed is a hooded bassinette in the same condition as the bed. A skirt hangs around the trim obscuring the inside. The cooing of an infant resonates from within the bassinette. What do you do?
 
As you approach the child, give me a perception check **[DC14 notices the corpses no longer have a shadow. Everyone else is surprised in the first round.]** Roll initiative
 
After defeating the shadows, give me a perception check **[DC9]** You notice a pulsating blue glow resonating from inside the bassinette.
 
**Improv this part. Let them peer in and see what looks like a leathery doll. A blue flame emerges from the doll. The wisp will only attack if provoked. Otherwise it floats out of the window "and disappears into the house across the way." In truth, the wisp is going into the direction of the graveyard, but being incorporeal, takes the shortest route through the Clergy's house.**
 
Upper closet:  
Against the wall is a shelf with a locked lockbox **containing 2d6gp1d10sp2d12cp and 2d4gp worth of gemstones.** The lockbox is very old and can be broken into with a good hit.  
The floor of the closet to the left in the upper floor gives way and the character that walks through falls to the first floor and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
 
What do you do from here? **If any of them look out the window, they'll see a small child beckoning them to follow.**
 
**Staircase collapses when the party is leaving the house.**
 
**If the party ignored the haunting, he is standing at the door leading to the main room**
