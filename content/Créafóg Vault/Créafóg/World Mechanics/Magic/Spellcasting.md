Casting spells should be exhausting. You are bending the fabric of reality to your whims and that should be represented.

When you cast a spell, make a saving throw using your spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is equal to three times the spell level you are casting. Failure gains a level of exhaustion, failing by more that 5 gains 2 levels. Rolling a natural 1 increases the tier of failure by 1 i.e. if your roll succeeds by less than 5 and you rolled a natural 1, you gain a level of exhaustion instead of being fatigued. Succeeding on this save fatigues the caster, unless they save by more than 5. A natural 20 means they don't use the slot regardless of spell level (including level 9). Note: a natural 20 doesn't necessarily mean that the caster succeeds by more than 5 and may still be fatigued.
