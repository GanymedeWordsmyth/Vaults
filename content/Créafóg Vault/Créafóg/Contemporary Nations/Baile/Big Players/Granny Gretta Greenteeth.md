# Highlights
Annis hag that lives in the forest west of Erolyn in a log cabin. Most of the furniture in the cabin are mimics. Granny's house and forest is also home to ogres, trolls, and other shunned, unintelligent giantfolk.

When Erolyn was created, it split Granny's precious forest. In response, she has a few plans for revenge against the humans. She cares little about their subjugation, or subjugation in general, she wants her forest back.

Revenge plans:
	[[Baloratukkin]]
	Doppelgangers
	Corruption of children

# Who is Granny?
## Background
## Roleplaying Granny
### Personality traits
I always have what you need. But always check the price tag.
I choose my words carefully, what I ask for payment is rarely what you think it is.
I require all my bargains to be put in writing and signed in clients' blood
### Ideals
Change: I will metamorphose into every kind of hag and live a century as each, becoming something even greater in the end (Choatic)
### Bonds
Involved in a centuries-long feud with the hags of the [[Créafóg/Contemporary Nations/Baile/Aladewyr/Dreadmire]], [[Oma Avalina Morgan Helder]], [[Mutter Miri Evenwood]], and [[Tante Wonda Marivaldi]]
### Flaw
I can't resist flirting with a handsome man
## Granny's Shack
Lavishly decorated with sticks, leaves, and flowers, this Radagast style house is where Granny lives. Inside, Granny keeps a plethora of exotic wares. This shack is actually a pocket dimension that parallels the woods away from civilization. As such, she is capable of moving the doorway to the shack to different parts of the woods. After moving the doorway, she then builds a frame around it to fit it into the scenery. From the outside, this would look as though the shack teleports around. Her apparent age suggests that she's well traveled and has seen many things in the world
## Wares
There are many ways to pay for Granny's wares other than coin, including favors.
- Information (not cheap)
- Weapons and potions
### Forms of Payment
- You can also purchase things at Granny's shack with your soul. See [[Soul Schism Index#Selling your soul]] for more details. Granny, while clever and will take advantage, she believes in balanced trading for wares and services rendered and thus will tell her clients when this comes up that the party need not sell their whole soul. Just a fragment will do just fine.
## Granny's Shapeshifters
Granny is a master at crafting shapeshifters. Mimics and Doppelgangers are her favorites to craft and most of her shack is filled with the former. The latter she sends out on infiltration missions across Créafóg.
# Plans and Motivations
So effectively what's going to happen, at least she hopes, is that the three major human settlements will fall. If they are defended, at least one of them will either fall or become destabilized enough for one of her doppelgangers to step in. Regardless of what happens, she will whisper in [[Grutok the Brutal]]'s ear that someone will be returning to usurp his throne. Her plan is that whoever ends up on the throne will trust her after she has backed them since the beginning. "Orcs are stupid after all," she'd say.
