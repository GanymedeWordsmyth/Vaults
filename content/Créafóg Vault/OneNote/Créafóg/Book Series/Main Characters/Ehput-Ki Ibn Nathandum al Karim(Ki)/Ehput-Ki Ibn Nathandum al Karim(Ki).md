Having finally found the location of the Heaven's Chronical, Ki is on his way to collect it.
 
Personality Traits  
I have no connection with emotions and honestly don't really understand them much.  
Being a physically weak person, I understand very well there is relative safety in numbers.  
Fear and pain is a powerful motivator. I often turn to unscrupulous methods when I know someone has information I seek.  
Ideals  
Preservation. Those who don't prepare themselves for what will come often find themselves on the dinner plate. (Lawful)  
Bonds  
My life's work is a series of tomes related to the study of extraplanar realms and the entities that reside there.  
Flaws  
I am always the smartest person in the room. To the point where I am easily frustrated with others  
My vanity and selfishness can be used against me.
