Captured by the drow! A fate you wouldn't wish upon even your worst enemy, yet here you are - locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You look around and see there are others shackled with you, in an underground outpost far, far away from the light of the sun.  
Over the past several days, Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym visits to watch her minions torture and brutalize you as you go through your daily chores. She appears robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck.  
Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life belongs to her. "Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive." Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.
 
High Priestess Ilvara of House Mizzrym,
 
This is Matron Urdra of House Zyz'Nsizbar. I humbly request your assistance in the recapture of those of House Roh'Duradrin. Should you accept, you would be owed a great debt from an aspiring minor Noble House as we make our way to becoming a Major House. The names of those who have escaped are as follows:
 
- Findigil Roh'Duradrin, Roh Drow Spy
- Dranu Roh'Duradrin, Roh Drow Sorceress
- Belbol, Roh Duergar Slave
 
Many thanks for your consideration,  
Matron Urdra Zyz'Nsizbar
