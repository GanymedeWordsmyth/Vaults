challenges:  
Rain Storm: -3 on checks for the day  
Standing Stone Trap  
Ilusion: Murder of crows - tiny green hallucinogenic spiders
 
Murder  
of crows/green spiders  
Perception: check at night. DC 18 (because they are normal sized  
spiders and you wouldn’t know to be wary of them)  
You wake the next day and continue on with the trek to the lost  
temple. The lake glitters distantly to your left when you notice a black cloud coming in from the other shore. After a few minutes, the cloud resolves itself to a mass of undulating crows. You look everywhere for cover but find that the nearest shelter of  
trees is a mile away. Every step closer to the forest seems to take you further from where you want to go...and the murder of crows descends upon you.  
(1d6 damage each round for each of them)  
No matter what damage they do, there efforts seem futile. If someone  
can perform a 10 arcana check they will know that this is an illusion. A further check arcana check will tell them to not fight but instead realize that they are in a dream. Make a DC 8 Intelligence check and find themselves back at their camp and covered  
with green spiders.
 
Standing  
Stones in the hills  
As  
the sun begins to crest down the sky, you see a circle of stones in the distance about a mile away from where you are now. They were not on the map that but are near the pass you were planning on traveling through. (If they approach) Riding up to them, the  
stones resemble narrow pillars that rise about seven feet out of the ground. The grass is more green and fertile here than the previous hills and upon closer inspection, you see a profusion of animal carcassess and skeletons littering the ground around the  
stone. (They are mostly animal but a 15 medicine check reveals a male and female halfling’s bones amongst the rest. Anything they carried has long since rotted away)  
Your party leaves the stones and enters the pass between the hills,  
but after fifteen minutes, you come to a rise and see more standing stones in the distance. (This is a magical area and an infinite loop. Any walking away from the stones in any direction sends them back to the stones.)  
Ways out:  
Destruction of the stones  
Dispelling magic  
Character’s ingenuity
 
Quicksand:  
A survival lower than 15 steers the leader of the group through this trap in the DMG.
