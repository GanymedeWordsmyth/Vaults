Types of illusion magic  
Figment - creates an image or sound that isn't there but cannot make something appear to be something else  
Glamour - illusions that fool all of the senses at once and can also make creatures and objects disappear  
Pattern - similar to figment illusions, but they also can affect the minds of those perceiving them, often with negative effects  
Phantasm - personal mental images conjured into a target's mind that can't be observed by anyone else  
Shadow - illusions weaved with part of the Shadowfell which gives the illusion a quasi-real state that can affect the world around it directly.
