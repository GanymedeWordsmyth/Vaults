Okay, I've come up with a pretty decent battlemap for the church.
 
Areas:

- Foyer
- Reception
- Office
- Basement
- Storage behind foyer
- Nave and pulpit
- Sanctuary (behind pulpit)
- Ladder to the bell tower
- Preacher's room
- Outdoors storage room
 
Creatures:

- Dybbuks
    
    - Zombies
    - Zombie animals
- Tempus Cari
- These two are both looking for a powerful item hidden beneath the mirage arcane that is the church, unable to access it. In previous games I made this the the gem of Fraaz Urb'luu, but it can be anything that legendarily powerful and cursed.
