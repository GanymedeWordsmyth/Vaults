## Notes
• Guide Stacia's conversation with Pix: make points to check off, remind Steph of the ones she missed
	○ Getting into the port town requires using a special hand sign to let the guards know that you are bringing in a tiefling.
• Montage them to Port Aldshore
• Foreshadow that something doesn't feel right, perception check to notice extra eyes.
• Someone jumps out from behind and pulls down Pix's cowl and starts yelling.
• A big mob starts to gather, 1 rounds to get away from the mob before it attacks (this simulates that Stacia knows what's to come and react accordingly). Remind Stacia (aka tell Steph) she cannot go to the safehouse while being chased. She has to lose her pursuers first.
• 1 round to try to lose the mob until Rose finally catches up with them and directs them to a safe passage
• Skill challenge to get to the sewers, come up with the skill challenge.
• Once they get there, they'll eventually meet Caelynn before heading to the organization. Tell Tiff that she may have to convince the others why she can go to the organization.
• When the party does reach the Streets, what happens?
	○ First things first, the Renegade of Smoke would congratulate Stacia on a job well done and give Pix an amulet of disguise self.
	○ I eventually want the Curator to meet them and tell them about the rival thieves guild that is encroaching
	○ If the party talks about the oozes and such, this will make the Renegade uneasy and the Curator will nod their head in a "it's okay" tone. They will then explain what is going on in the city.
		§ "oh, absolutely not. Only the dying die. These people are in a coma and we do our best to take as good care of them as possible." Halwen would say 
		§ Describe that the sudden influx of bodies from the illness is putting a lot of strain on the museum. This strain is preventing the Curator from properly screening the minds of the dying and creating new oblexes without them going mad. They are now running amuck in the city and need to be detained. Bring them to the Curator for judgement.
	○ At a dramatic point, the orcs attack the town and have to be dealt with. If the players go to the town's defense, Caelynn will see a familiar tabaxi and half-orc standing over several dead orcs as they get stricken down. They are too far away to help them out.
	○ This would mean that the players have three directions they can go in. Follow through on the orcs to see what's up there (Stacia would know most about that), figure out how to stop the rival thieves' guild from encroaching on this territory (Rose can use her connections for this), or arrest the rogue oblexes (Caelynn can help here). The party, of course, could ignore all of this and go in a completely different direction.
## To the Sewers!
Creating a skill challenge for Stacia to get Pixto to the sewers amidst a forming mob and later with Rose's aid presents an exciting opportunity for dynamic gameplay. Here's a detailed skill challenge setup that focuses on stealth, quick thinking, and the use of the urban environment to evade pursuit:

Use the rules for Running a Chase
At the end of each turn, roll on the Urban Chase Complications table for the next character's turn. Each ally makes the relevant saving throw or ability check. The mob doesn't roll on the table.
Can only use skills in which a character is trained and once a character tried to use a skill, they cannot use that skill again.

Intro:
	As you enter the town a little after high time, the whole town is thrumming with life. In the distance to your right, you hear seagulls and ships, and to your left, you hear carts delivering goods to the various shops. You don't know the city too well, but you know it well enough to know where a couple of the sewer entrances are. Before you is the main road and you know there are two alleyways up ahead.
	As you walk forward, you start to hear a soapbox sermon. Getting closer, you can hear that it is an anti-government sermon, specifically speaking about the government bringing in half-human outsiders. Walking more forward you notice he is standing between you and the alleyways. What do you do?

Skill Challenge Overview
	- Objective: Lose the mob and sneak to the sewers undetected.
	- Successes Needed: 5
	- Failures Before Consequence: 3 (Leading to another chase or confrontation)
	- Rounds: 1 round before the mob forms, 3 additional rounds for the challenge (Rose shows up at the end of the 3rd round to assist).

Round 1: Initial Reaction
	- Stacia's Actions: As the mob begins to form, Stacia has a brief window to act. She can use any one of the following or come up with her own:
		- (DC=14)Intimidation to temporarily disperse the crowd's focus, buying some time. This will increase the failures before consequences to 4
		- (DC=15)Athletics or Acrobatics to quickly move or create a barrier with nearby objects, slowing down pursuers. This will grant one automatic success
		- (DC=15)Perception or Insight to quickly assess the situation and crowd dynamics. This will allow the group one failed reroll

Rounds 2 and beyond: Evading the Mob 
During these rounds, Stacia and Pixto must use a combination of skills to evade the mob. Each round, they choose from the following actions or create their own. They can only use an option once, until all options are used:
	1. Stealth (Dexterity): Move quietly through alleys or crowds to avoid detection. Failure might attract attention, causing a few mob members to spot and chase them.
	2. Athletics (Strength) or Acrobatics (Dexterity): Navigate over obstacles or through tight spaces. Failure could result in noise or falling, drawing attention.
	3. Deception or Performance (Charisma): Create a distraction or disguise their appearance. Failure means the ruse is seen through, leading to a potential chase.
	4. Insight (Wisdom): Predict the mob's next move or find the safest route through the chaos. Failure could lead to a dead-end or running into a larger group of the mob.
	5. Perception (Wisdom): To notice safe paths, shortcuts, or hidden dangers
	6. Survival (Wisdom): For navigating through urban environments or using knowledge of the sewers to find the best entry point.

Rose's Arrival and Final Push to the Sewers
	• Upon Rose's arrival at the beginning of round 3, she offers her knowledge of the city to aid in their escape. She can contribute:
		○ Investigation (Intelligence): Find hidden paths or sewer entrances known only to the locals. This results in avoiding one round of complications
		○ Persuasion (Charisma): Convince a bystander to hide them or provide a quick distraction. This results in an automatic success.
		○ Sleight of Hand (Dexterity): Rose creates a distraction that draws the mob's attention elsewhere. This reduces the number of failures by 1.
		○ Athletics (Strength): Very high DC to attempt to provide an immediate route to the sewers, bypassing the skill challenge entirely.

Additional Challenges
	- Environmental Challenges: Describe the changing environment as they move through Port Aldshore. Narrow alleys, slippery cobblestones, or crowded market squares can add to the challenge.
	- Urgent Decisions: At certain points, Stacia might have to make quick decisions—take a risky shortcut or a longer, safer route? Each choice can have immediate consequences on their success or failure.


Consequences of Failure
	- If Stacia successfully intimidated the crowd on the initial reaction, the first failure does nothing.
	- 1 Failure: The pursuers gain ground, making subsequent checks more difficult as the pressure mounts.
	- 2 Failures: A minor confrontation occurs, leading to a possible combat encounter or the party being temporarily slowed down.
	- 3 Failures: The pursuers catch up, leading to a significant combat encounter, the party being captured, or another serious consequence.
	- Continuous failures might also attract city guards or other unwanted attention, complicating their escape to the sewers.

Success and Reaching the Sewers
	- Achieving 5 successes means Stacia, Pixto, and Rose successfully navigate the urban landscape and evade the mob, reaching the sewer entrance undetected. This not only allows them to escape immediate danger but also sets the stage for their next move in the shadows of Port Aldshore.

This skill challenge emphasizes teamwork, quick thinking, and the characters' abilities to interact with and utilize their environment under pressure, making for an engaging and memorable session.
