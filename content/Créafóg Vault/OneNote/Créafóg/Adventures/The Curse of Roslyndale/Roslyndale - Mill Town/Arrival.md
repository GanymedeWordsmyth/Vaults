**The party arrives in the late afternoon. Just enough time to go to a shop or two before finding rooms at the inn.**
 
**Ask everyone to wait until the long rest is over before resetting their character sheets.**
 
Accent is mid-western
 
The sun is maybe a few hours above the horizon as a town comes into sight in the distance. Checking your map, it seems like this is your destination. As you approach the town give me a perception check **(DC13)**. You are the first to notice the buildings look a little run down and could use some love and attention. The rest of you see the same once you get closer. Once you arrive in the town, Allanon give me a perception check **[DC13 to see if they notice a very faint smell of ozone.]**
 
**Remember that shopkeepers and other townsfolk answer questions adjacent to whatever was asked.**
 
**Write down everything the players buy, where they bought the things, and for how much they bought them.**
 
Let them roam around a bit and talk to the townsfolk. When they inevitably enter the first shop, read the following:  
You see at the counter finishing her business with the shopkeeper a woman wearing a finely crafted black, floor length dress with elbow long gloves. Her elegant lace veil is so thin, it almost looks like it was made from spider's silk. She nods to you all as she exits, "it's nice to see some new faces around here." You can hear the tears in her eyes as she speaks.  
"Fairweather Mr. Marlborough," she says to the man behind the counter before continuing about her day.  
"Fairweather Mistress Lackman," he responds before turning to you. "Poor lady, lost all three of her dearest not long ago to the plague. Well anyways, my apologies for such a dreary introduction to our little town. My name is Mr. Marlborough and this here is my shop. How may I be of assistance today?"
 
From here, the party is free to roam where ever and ask what ever they'd like. After visiting the second place, the sun has gone down.
