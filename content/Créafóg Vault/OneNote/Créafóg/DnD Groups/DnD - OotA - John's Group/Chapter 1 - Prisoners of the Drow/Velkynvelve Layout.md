**1. Southern Watch Post**  
As you peer in, you see a pretty dull room with just two zurkhwood chairs and a small, round zurkhwood table. Two drow are present, one is asleep in his chair and the other is playing some kind of dice game on the table. You see nothing really of interest in this room.  
Any light from the passage or the cavern below automatically draws the guards attention.  
Guards are under orders to report intruders immediately, and to keep them under observation. They take no other action unless ordered or unless they see signs of a significant threat. In that case, they blow a high, shrill note on a warning trumpet to alert the whole outpost.
 
**2. Barracks**  
You enter the room and see 6 pallets. Around the pallets sit a small zurkhwood chest, and a side table. On one of the pallets is a drow resting in a meditative state. The barracks is unlit but you see spider silk hooks made for lanterns.  
The second room is much the same as the first; 6 pallets with a zurkhwood chest, a side table and a resting drow.
 
**3. Main Hall**  
Upon entering this cave, notice that this has to be the mess hall. This cave has four circular tables carved from zurkhwood, each surrounded by five chairs. In the back is a food prep and storage area, containing stocks of dried and fresh fungi, dried fruits, cheeses, preserved meat, and a few jars of spices. A heavy iron brazier provides heat for cooking along with dim light, but much of the food is served cold.  
25% chance that 1d4 **drow** are in the main hall eating or entertaining themselves with dice or card games. If any drow are present, 1d4 **quaggoths** are also on hand, serving and cleaning. If there are no drow present, there is a 25% chance that a lone **quaggoth** is here performing its duties.
 
**4. Elite Barracks**  
(Roll a d4 to see in which room the warrior rests.)  
As you climb in, you see fine furniture placed around the chamber, including zurkhwood chairs and small tables around which they sit. [On the pallet is a drow elite warrior resting.] You see a decorated chest in the corner next to the pallet.  
One off-duty **drow elite warrior** rests in one of the chambers here at any given time There is a 50% chance that one **quaggoth** is also present, carrying out chores such as cleaning up or delivering water. Either is hostile to intruders, but they might choose to flee and warn the outpost rather than attack, depending of the odds.  
Two hanging towers flank the platform. Each tower has two chambers, with a rope ladder running between the upper and lower chamber through a zurkhwood trapdoor. You see fine furniture in these chambers,
 
**5. Lift**  
Two **quaggoth** attendants remain by the lift to watch for a signal from below for the basket to be lowered. They are on guard in case anyone other than a drow or one of their kind approaches.  
Attached to the edge of the barracks platform is a winch-and-basket device consisting of a large swinging arm that carriers a thin cord of strong spider silk. The cord runs through a series of pulleys from a hand-cranked horizontal spool to a heavy woven basket suspended at the end. The basket is kept up on the platform except when it is in use.
 
**6a. Shrine to Lolth (Front)**  
Shrine activity

|   |   |
|---|---|
|d6|Activity|
|1-2|Asha is in the room alone|
|3-4|Asha and 1d4 **drow** are engaged in worship|
|5-6|The shrine is empty|

A steep rope bridge leads from the walkway ledge to the uppermost level of the largest hanging tower. Roll a Perception (Wis) check (against DC 12). As you enter, you look around to see dark silken mats covering the floor of the circular chamber. The mats have a pale wed-strand pattern woven through them in silvery thread.  
Those that fail the check look around to see a giant spider standing in the center of the room posing in an aggressive stance. Otherwise, as you enter you see a large lifelike 10-foot sculpture of a giant spider resting at the head of a broad pedestal carved from zurkhwood. This statue sits in the middle of the room positioned in such a way that it looks like the spider is in the middle of the web.  
If Asha is present, she (and the other drow) stand(s) irate as you enter, exclaiming that you are defiling the sacred Shrine to Lolth and bids you to leave.  
If the room is empty, Sarith explains what you're look at.
 
**6b. Shrine to Lolth (Back)**  
The back half of the chamber, behind the alter, is piled with a semicircle of pillows and cushions. Resting among these is a **giant spider** trained and kept by the priestesses. The cushions give the spider sufficient concealment to hide from anyone entering the tower from the front. A character must succeed on a Perception (Wis) check against the spider's Stealth (Dex) check to spot it before it moves.
 
**7. Ilvara's Quarters**  
Roll a d6. On 1 - 2, the priestess is here. On a 1, Shoor Vandree is also here with her. Ilvara is furious if anyone dares to enter her quarters unbidden. If the characters catch her here, she casts _web_, _animals,_ or _insect plague_ to bedevil them while she flees and calls for help. If Shoor Vandree is with Ilvara, he attacks to cover her escape.  
On the walls are hung with black mesh resembling a spider's web, extending from a central spot on the ceiling out to the walls, then draped down like curtains. Thick, woven mats cover the floor, while a low platform is covered with cushions and pillows to make a broad, divan-like bed. One side of the chamber contains a small table and two chairs, while the other holds a small shrine to Lolth, draped in white silk. A heavy chest of black-stained zurkhwood sits at the foot of the bed.
 
**8. Shoor's Quarters**  
As you descend to the lowest chamber of the stalactite, you quickly notice that this room is highly decorated. This living space has cushions laid across floor mats, a small carved table with two chairs, and a sturdy zurkhwood chest. Being the lower part of Ilvara's chamber, you assume this one to belong to her lieutenant and consort, Shoor Vandree. He is not here at the moment though.
 
**9. Waterfall**  
Water vents through the cracks in the ceiling near the eastern wall between the stalactites of the priestess's tower and the guard tower, creating a small waterfall that pours down to the cavern floor and forms a natural pool. You have seen quaggoths gather small barrels of water from the head of the waterfall to serve the outpost's needs.  
The water makes the stone wall within 10 feet of it difficult to scale. Any creature attempting to do so has disadvantage on checks made to climb. Any character who falls lands in the pool below, taking no damage.
 
**10. Guard Tower**  
The guard tower is connected by rope bridges to the slave pen and the walkway alongside the priestess's tower and observes the cavern, the western passage, and the slave pen.  
Two drow and a decorated drow warrior sit around a zurkhwood table playing dice games. Around the warriors are a smaller side table, and spider silk webbing set with hooks for hanging equipment.
 
**11. Slave Pen**  
An attempt to unlock the gate requires a Dex (Stealth) check against the guards' passive Wis (Perception) check, and a DC 20 Dex check using thieves' tools. Make-shift tools has the same check but with a disadvantage.  
Breaking the gate requires a DC 20 Str check.  
Any attempt to cast magic consumes the slot or magic item charge and has no effect. The wards don't suppress or negate spell effects originating outside the pen, however.  
Creatures inside the pen can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.
 
**12. Quaggoth Den**  
Walking down a set of stone steps is the den where the quaggoths of the outpost sleep. The inside is littered with nest-like mounds of debris and the scattered bones of the quaggoths' past meals.  
They attack any intruder that isn't a drow, spider, or quaggoth. However, they won't initially attack unknown quaggoths or drow on sight, but they know all those assigned to the outpost and will question strangers. Derendil and Sarith's status as prisoners is known to them.
 
**13. Northern Watch Post**  
Exactly the same as the Southern Watch Post. Two bored drow sit playing dice. Although these drow are more irritable being in such close proximity to the quaggoth den, the slave pen, and the pool.  
A Dec (Stealth) check against a passive Wis (Perception) check allows passage.
 
**14. Pool**  
Water pours down from the waterfall forming a very deep pool. You don't see the bottom of pool and can't see how deep it is. The pool then flows out into an underground river that travels into the darkness. You've seen that the quaggoths get the outpost's water needs from the waterfall, and because of this the drow use the pool to dump waste and garbage. Although this fouls the surface of the pool, the constant flow keeps the water beneath the surface clear.

_Zurkhwood_  
A massive mushroom that can reach 30 - 40 feet.  
Large grain spores are edible and nutritionally equivalent to 1d4 + 4 lbs. of food. More important for its hard and woody stalks. It's also one of the few sources of timber in the Underdark, and is used to make furniture, containers, bridges, and rafts, among other things. Skilled crafters can use stains, sanding, and polishing to bring out different patterns in the zurkhwood.

_Barracks Treasure_  
The equipment of the resting drow is under his pallet: a shortsword, a hand crossbow with a case of 20 hand crossbow bolts, a chain shirt, and a 100-foot coil of silk rope with a small grappling hook.  
Each of the six chests in each barracks contains a flask of drow poison used to treat crossbow bolts. Each flask has enough poison to treat 20 bolts.

_Main Hall Treasure_  
There's nothing of value here other than what the drow have on them, but characters can loot the larder for the equivalent of up to 30 days of rations, limited by what they can carry. Each day of rations for one character weights 2 pounds.

_Elite Barracks Treasure_  
The equipment of the resting drow warrior is stowed beneath his pallet: a shortsword, a hand crossbow with a case of 20 bolts, a chain shirt, and a 100-foot coil of silk rope with a small grappling hook at the end.  
Each of the chests in the four chambers contains a flask of drow poison used to treat crossbow bolts. One flask has enough poison to treat 20 bolts. The chests also contain two changes of clothes and:

1. 4 sp, 2 gp, the deed for a parcel of land in a realm unknown to you, half a floor plan for an outpost, a small wooden statuette of a smug halfling, and a silver skull the size of a coin.
2. 7 sp, 3 gp, a tiny sketch portrait of a goblin, two toy soldiers, a bag containing forty-seven humanoid teeth, one of which is rotten, and a tiny silver bell without a clapper.
3. 6 sp, 1gp, a tiny cage with no door, and a tine silver icon of a raven.
4. 11 sp, 4 gp, and a vest with one hundred tiny pockets

_Using the Lift_  
Up to four Med creatures can fit somewhat snugly in the basket, which is swung over the edge of the platform and lowered to the cavern floor below by turning the spool using attached handles. This requires a successful DC 18 Str check, normally provided by two quaggoth servants (one of which makes the check while the other assists with the Help action).  
Once on the cave floor, the basket can be loaded with other passengers or up to 800 pounds of cargo, then lifted back up to the platform in the same way. It takes 4 rounds for the basket to move between the platform and the floor under normal operation.

_Shrine Treasure_  
The alter is flanked by a pair of silver candlesticks (worth 25gp each). They hold thick black candles, lit only when a ritual is being performed in the shrine.  
The eight "eyes" of the spider statue are eight pieces of polished jet - four small ones (worth 5 gp each) and four larger ones (worth 10 gp each). Any non-drow who possesses these gems fall under a curse from Lolth. All spiders and spiderlike creatures attack the bearer on sight, and such creatures have advantage on checks to detect the possessor of the stones. The curse lasts until all the stones are given into the safekeeping of a drow worshiper of Lolth or the gems are subject to a _remove curse_ spell.

_Ilvara's Treasures_  
The side table holds a small silver-framed mirror worth 10 gp. The small shrine to Lolth is carved of zurkhwood and bone, and inlaid with semiprecious stones. It is worth 50 gp if the characters can find a buyer for it.  
The chest contains a variety of silken garments and personal items. There is a silver chain headdress set with small onyx stones, worth 50 gp, and a drawstring bag containing two _potions of healing._ A smaller leather purse contains 24 gp, 30 sp, and a small moonstone worth 20 gp, while another purse is Ilvara's spare spell component pouch.  
Additionally, the chest contains any valuables once held by the characters and NPC's, including any spellbooks, components, focuses, and magic items lost to the adventurers.

_Trapped Chest_  
The chest is locked, and Ilvara keeps the key in a hidden pocket on the inside of her belt. The lock is trapped with a poison needle tipped with drow poison, which is activated if any attempt is made to open the lock without the proper key. The victim takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Con saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. A successful DC 20 Investigation (Int) check reveals the trap. A character using thieves' tools can make a successful DC 15 Dex check to disarm it. Picking the lock requires thieves' tools and another successful DC 15 Dex check.

_Watch Post_  
Dex (Stealth) check against guards' passive Wis (Perception) score of 12 allows unnoticed passage.

_Barracks Chests_  
Two sets of clothing and:

1. A scrap of cloth from an old banner, a dead scarab beetle the size of your hand, and a set of bone pipes
2. A tiny cage with no door, and a pipe that blows bubbles.
3. A rope necklace from which dangles four mummified elf fingers and A tiny gnome-crafted music box that plays a sung you dimly remember from your childhood.
4. A vest with one hundred tiny pockets
5. A gold coin minted in an unknown land, a knife that belonged to a relative, a silver spoon with an M engraved on the handle.
6. A mosaic tile with a multicolored, glazed surface, two toy soldiers, one with a missing head, an invitation to a party where you heard a murder happened, and a fragment of a beautiful song, written as musical notes on two pieces of parchment
7. A small cloth doll skewered with needles, a sheet of parchment up which is drawn a complex mechanical contraption, and a glass eye.
8. A rabbit's foot, and a dragon's bony talon hanging from a plain leather necklace.
9. A glass orb filled with water, in which swims a clockwork goldfish, and a small packet filled with pink dust
10. An empty wine bottle bearing a pretty label that reads, "The Wizard of Wines Winery, Red Dragon Crush, 331422-W," a dragon's bony talon hanging from a plain leather necklace, and a fragment of a beautiful song, written as musical notes on two pieces of parchment.
11. A small cloth doll skewered with needles, and a silver badge in the shape of a five pointed start.
12. An iron holy symbol devoted to an unknown god, and an empty glass vial that smells of perfume when opened.

_Shoor's Treasure_  
The table holds a pewter pitcher and a pair of matched goblets, worth a total of 1 gp.  
The chest contains Shoor's personal items and clothing, as well as a small purse containing 20 gp, a black velvet mask stitched with silver thread in a spider web pattern (worth 25 gp), a set of bone dice engraved with Elvish characters (worth 10 gp), a small black velvet bag containing a spider0shaped onyx brooch (worth 50 gp), and a flask of strong, syrupy blue liquor (worth 10 gp). The liquor leaves anyone who drinks it pleasantly poisoned for 1d4 hours.

_Trapped Chest_  
The chest is locked, and Ilvara keeps the key in a hidden pocket on the inside of her belt. The lock is trapped with a poison needle tipped with drow poison, which is activated if any attempt is made to open the lock without the proper key. The victim takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Con saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. A successful DC 20 Investigation (Int) check reveals the trap. A character using thieves' tools can make a successful DC 15 Dex check to disarm it. Picking the lock requires thieves' tools and another successful DC 15 Dex check.

_Guard Tower Treasure_  
The upper chamber stores extra arms and armor for the outpost. Characters who gain entrance see the following:  
6 chain shirts, 6 suits of studded leather armor, 6 shields, 6 hand crossbows, 20 cases and hand crossbow bolts, each case containing 20 bolts, 6 shortswords and 10 daggers, 6 bags of caltrops (20 caltrops per bag), 4 100-foot-long coils of silk rope, 2 building hammers (not usable as weapons), and 2 bags of iron spikes (10 spikes per bag).

_The Gray Ooze_  
A gray ooze lurks in the pool's shallows, blending perfectly with the dark, wet stone. It feeds on the waste dumped into the pool, along with the occasional creature that finds its way into the cavern or falls into the pool.  
The inhabitants of Velkynvelve remain unaware that the recent arrival of the demon lord Jubilex in the Underdark has made this ooze particularly aggressive and malevolent. In addition to attacking any creature in the pool, the ooze surges up to 10 feet out of the pool to attack creatures at its edge. When it does so, creatures within feet of the ooze telepathically sense a voice cry out, "Flesh for the Faceless Lord!"
