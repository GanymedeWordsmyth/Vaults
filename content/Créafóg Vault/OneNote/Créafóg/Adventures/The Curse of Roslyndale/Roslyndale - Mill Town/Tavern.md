The Salty Fish Tavern run by Millie and Henry Kinsley  
The Wandering Flower Inn
 
**Write down the total amount of money the party spends here in here.**
 
Plot point: it's marginally important that they rent a room here on their first night. Though, if the party insists they stay elsewhere for the evening, feel free to let them. You'll just have to do some DM magic and change some of the language going forward. The party will wake up in the spot they chose to bed down each morning. This is the only inn in town.

One drunken man responds that these two are clearly having an affair and that voices his opinions on how it's such a disgrace to her Godly husband to partake in such a thing. A large rolling pin strikes the man on the back of his bulbous head and he whips around to see Millie standing there scowling at him, "the Mistress has lost her children so you watch yours words regarding the poor dear, or I'll have them shoved up your arse!"  
The man looks to the man behind the bar who laughs a hearty laugh and shrugs, "if you want to fight her, it's your funeral, lad."
