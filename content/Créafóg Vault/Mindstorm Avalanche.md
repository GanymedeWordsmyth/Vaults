Ask Steph if she and Alex still want to learn some simple self defense stuff?

Tabaxi come from Qthix

The alchemical stuff I put under the witch hunter subclass should be available to all witch hunters, as should some cantrips (see Witcher spells)
    Witch hunters can expend a spell slot to grant (umbrella term). This extra (umbrella term) is equal to half your witch hunter level, rounded up, multiplied by the level of the expended spell slot.
    Actually, this wouldn't really work with the spell slinger. Alchemists can add this number either to the damage or duration of their alchemy solutions. Martial masters can add this number to their weapon damage.

Herald of Souls
Expertise and Mastery in spell and weapon attacks (very specific, expertise/mastery in only one specific spell or weapon)

Souls can be consumed or traded. When a soul is consumed, it empowers the creature that consumed the soul, giving the creature permanent buffs to stats. Some souls buff spells or spellcasting (gives extra spell slots/points), some give unlimited access to cast certain spells at-will, some buff physical or mental ability scores, etc.
