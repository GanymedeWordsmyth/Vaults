So the boarding house [[Rose Pietragalla]] lives in with her parents is on the same block as an orphange, and [[Rose Pietragalla]] knows the orphans and refers to them as "the kids from the neighborhood." Molly is one of the kids. She knows them about as well as you would know your neighbor's kids or regulars at your favorite coffee place.

When she got sick the other kids sought [[Rose Pietragalla]] out and asked her for help getting Molly to the "magic" place in the sewers that would make her better again. But most of the offerings would have been left by the other kids, Rose was just the escort.

If it helps if [[Rose Pietragalla]] left something with her, maybe a little drawing of Molly she did and then ripped out of her sketchbook journal and put in Molly's pocket. She would have signed it with a little rose doodle in the corner.

Molly was more "indoorsy" and quiet than the other kids,  but very polite, and if they were playing a game outside in the street she was usually nearby but sitting off to the side, studying a bug or trying to get a squirrel to eat out of her hand.

When Molly was brought to the sewers, she was unable to be saved from the leprosy by [[Halwen Groves]], but she passed the [[Oblexification]] screening process. Feeling pity on the poor child, [[OneNote/Créafóg/Créafóg/Baile/Port Aldshore/The Curator]], themselves, oblexified her, giving Molly her own [oblex spawn](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#oblex%20spawn_mpmm) form, where normally the [[Oblexification]] process was carried out by one of the [adult oblexes](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#adult%20oblex_mpmm), only to create a spawn when the [adult oblex](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#adult%20oblex_mpmm) had taken on too many personas. This [oblex spawn](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#oblex%20spawn_mpmm) roamed explored the sewers until finding [[Caelynn Moonwhisper]]]], who then named her Del.

Del was created using the memories of Molly, but is their own creature. Their personality, especially while they only have one persona, will greatly reflect Molly's.

At some point, I want the picture that [[Rose Pietragalla]] drew for Molly to fall out of Del's pocket. This should happen when Jess realizes that Del is Molly. This drawing was given to Del during creation.

Personality:
	Greatly fascinated by small creatures and insects.
	Prefers to be indoors (this could mean in the tent at camp, etc)
	Prefers to be alone either in contemplation or studying something like an insect or flower.
	Is very polite, and easily loved
	Likes to draw and doodle. Her art style closely resembles Roses. Her favorite thing to draw is a rose.
	If Del sees Rose's signature rose, she reacts with warmth and familiarity.
