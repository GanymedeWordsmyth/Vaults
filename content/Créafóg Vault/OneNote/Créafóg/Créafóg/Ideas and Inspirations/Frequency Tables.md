1st and 2nd Edition D&D had a "Frequency" field for every monster, which was used to determine how likely that monster may be encountered in a given area or region where it lived.
 
In the 1st Edition Monster Manual, it describes four types of frequency: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Very Rare. An easy way to construct random encounters using these frequencies is the d8 + d12 table.
 
d8+d12 Frequency  
2-3 Very Rare  
4 Very Rare/Rare  
5-6 Rare  
7-8 Uncommon  
9-13 Common  
14-15 Uncommon  
16-17 Rare  
18 Very Rare/Rare  
19-20 Very Rare  
In the 2nd Edition World Builder's Guidebook, page 81, they specify a distribution based on how civilized an area is (Rural, Frontier, and Wilderness), but it also states that the DM is free to ignore those guidelines if they wish. I'd post that table, but not sure where it falls under copyright, so I'll refrain.
 
In any case, 5th Edition doesn't have frequency listed for any monsters. What we need is a system that can be applied on the fly to assign frequencies to monsters as needed. This way, it can be used with current monsters, homebrew monsters, as well as monsters not yet created, without having to keep and update a database of some kind.
 
I use the idea of the 4 tiers of play in 5th edition, as a measuring stick to determine a monsters base frequency. I don't use the monster's CR for this, but the number of hit dice the monster has.
 
Hit Dice Frequency  
1-4 Common  
5-10 Uncommon  
11-16 Rare  
17+ Very Rare  
This is the monster's base frequency. It is further modified by a number of steps depending on the type of monster. Each step increases the monster's frequency by one category. Common becomes Uncommon. Uncommon becomes Rare. Rare becomes Very Rare. Once a monster has reached Very Rare, its frequency remains Very Rare.
 
Type Frequency modifier  
Aberration +1  
Beast +0  
Celestial +2  
Construct +1  
Dragon +1  
Elemental +1  
Fey +1  
Fiend +2  
Giant +1  
Humanoid +0  
Monstrosity +1  
Ooze +1  
Plant +1  
Undead +0  
Some quick examples:
 
Ankheg with 6HD, has a base frequency of Uncommon. The Monstrosity type bumps this up to Rare.
 
Vine Blight with 4HD, has a base frequency of Common. The Plant type makes it Uncommon.
 
Bugbear with 5HD, has a base frequency of Uncommon. The Humanoid type leaves it as Uncommon.
 
Couatl with 13HD, has a base frequency of Rare. The Celestial type would bump it up twice, but Very Rare is the limit, so Very Rare a Couatl is.
 
Tiger with 5HD, has a base frequency of Uncommon. The Beast type leaves this as Uncommon.
 
Giant Wolf Spider with 2HD, has a base frequency of Common. The Beast type leaves this as Common.
 
Bandit with 2HD, has a base frequency of Common. The Humanoid type leaves this as Common.
 
With this method you can pick an assortment of monsters you feel would fit an area or region, assign and sort them by frequency, then use their frequency to populate a random encounter table which takes those frequencies into account.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions about this system and I'll do my best to answer them.
