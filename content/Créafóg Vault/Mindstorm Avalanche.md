Tabaxi come from Qthix

The alchemical stuff I put under the witch hunter subclass should be available to all witch hunters, as should some cantrips (see Witcher spells)
    Witch hunters can expend a spell slot to grant (umbrella term). This extra (umbrella term) is equal to half your witch hunter level, rounded up, multiplied by the level of the expended spell slot.
    Actually, this wouldn't really work with the spell slinger. Alchemists can add this number either to the damage or duration of their alchemy solutions. Martial masters can add this number to their weapon damage.

Herald of Souls

Expertise and Mastery in spell and weapon attacks (very specific, expertise/mastery in only one specific spell or weapon)

Souls can be consumed or traded. When a soul is consumed, it empowers the creature that consumed the soul, giving the creature permanent buffs to stats. Some souls buff spells or spellcasting (gives extra spell slots/points), some give unlimited access to cast certain spells at-will, some buff physical or mental ability scores, etc.

Magus means sorcerer

Sorcerers were created by stealing power from [[The Endless]]. Being mortals, they knew not what foley they made. The humans did so without the knowledge of other lineages. Once the elves found out, they sought to correct the human's mistake, thence was born the witch hunters.
	Slowly but surely, the witch hunters sought to retrieve that which was stolen.
