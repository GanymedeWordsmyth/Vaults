Thank you for adding that crucial detail. Let's refine Mr. Cotton's backstory with this new information:
 
### Refined Backstory of Mr. Cotton:
 
In your world, Mr. Cotton's story is a complex tapestry woven with secrecy, innocence, and desperation, deeply entangled with the Lackman family's own tragic narrative.
 
### Seeking Refuge in Secrecy:
 
As a sorcerer in a world where his kind is pursued by the witch hunters of the Sovereign Concordat, Mr. Cotton sought refuge in Roslyndale, finding an unlikely ally in Mr. Heward Lackman. Heward, empathetic to Cotton's plight, offered him sanctuary and a new identity as a local wizard. This secret arrangement was initially hidden from Heward's family to protect both Cotton and themselves.
 
### An Innocent Revelation:
 
The secret of Cotton's true identity and his precarious situation remained well-guarded until an innocent discovery by Heward's daughter, Silifrey. Gifted with telepathic abilities, Silifrey inadvertently uncovered the truth about Cotton's past. Her naive revelation to her mother, unaware of the gravity and danger of being a sorcerer, set a tragic chain of events into motion.
 
### Blackmail by the Mistress:
 
Upon learning of Cotton's true nature, Mistress Westra Lackman, already reeling from the loss of her husband and children, saw an opportunity in Cotton's magical abilities. She used the information about his identity as leverage to compel him into attempting a resurrection spell for her deceased children – a task far beyond his capabilities and fraught with danger.
 
### The Catastrophic Ritual:
 
Bound by blackmail and caught in a web of desperation and fear, Cotton acquiesced to the Mistress's demands. The ritual, conducted under these strained circumstances, failed disastrously, unleashing a shockwave that cursed the entire town of Roslyndale, trapping its residents in a perpetual loop of their last day.
 
### A Tragedy Born of Secrets and Desperation:
 
In this revised narrative, Mr. Cotton emerges as a figure whose fate is irrevocably tied to the Lackmans – a refuge turned into a reluctant participant in a tragedy. Silifrey's unintended revelation and the Mistress's subsequent actions paint a picture of a family inadvertently entwined in a sorcerer's doomed attempt to evade a world that hunted him. This backstory adds depth to the characters and the overarching narrative, highlighting themes of secrecy, innocence, and the unintended consequences of desperate actions.
