Old notes:
	Plabàs Frik (Gaelic for pestilence and death) struck a bargain with the hags of Dreadmire to gain knowledge and power over the secrets of [the Weave?]. Plabàs has forced the citizens of Nirani to provide sacrifices so he can continue his quest in ultimate knowledge and power. Eventually becoming far stronger, he cast the hags out of the decrepit ruins and into the Dreadmire swamp where they now reside, plotting his demise.
	 After pushing the hags out of Marwolaeth, the inhabitants of Callobre Forest started to push the boundaries against the dead forest. In response, Frik had created Urraim Sealgair, the Death Knight Lord, along with his steed, Scáfarcapall (Gaelic for terrifying horse) to defend Marwolaeth.
