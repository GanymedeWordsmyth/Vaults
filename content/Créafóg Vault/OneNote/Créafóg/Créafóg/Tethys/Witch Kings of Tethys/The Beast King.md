King of the hunt, based on Hircine  
Dense forest with a portal to a massive pocket plane. The portal opens up into more dense forest. There are many tears that lead to this area. Some of the portals are almost invisible, transporting victims to the Wild Lands without them even realizing they left the PMP  
To the east is a vast grassy savanna.  
To the west is an endless marshland.  
To the south is an expansive desert  
To the north is meadows with giant mountains in the distance. No matter how far you travel to the mountains, they are always the same distance from you.  
There is a dark, red sun overhead, though it can't be seen from within the forest.
 
Much of the plane is inhabited by therianthropes, wild cattle, and unicorns. The plane itself seeps into the creatures in this realm, making them larger than their PMP counterparts.
 
The marshland is populated with wisps, wispmothers, and spectral fauna.
