Chef Gorren Ramski **is** Chef Gordon Ramsay
 
When the characters walk into the kitchen, they are firstly scolded for being late **[need a funny phrase for this].** Choose, either randomly or by picking, of one the characters to be food prep (Allanon). Chef Ramski calls them over to take over in finishing prep. Then choose someone as the dishwasher (Yg) and he will have them start washing **things**. Finally, choose someone to be cook (Damp√©), who will take up the mantle of cooking the food. If anyone is left over, they take the roll of assistant and, after a successful roll, can choose either the cook or food prep to give advantage on their roll.  
Lore-wise, the character's knowledge of cooking and such is being subsidized by the spirits of the staff that used to work at the estate. This is a character sheet challenge, so the players aren't required to have any knowledge of how cooking works.
 
If the characters decided they don't want to do this, Chef Ramski will attack them. **Need stats for Chef Ramski**
 
Chef Ramski oversees the entire operation. ~~A failure results in some kind of insult and debuff. A success results in praise and a buff~~
 
~~Challenge rolls:~~  
~~Dishwasher - chemicals, endurance, strength~~  
~~Cutlery, cups, and plates will be thrown into the dish pit to be washed~~  
~~Food prep - knowledge, dexterity, focus (wisdom)~~  
~~Will be sent to the larder and pantry to prepare ingredients for the cook.~~  
~~Cook - knowledge or intuition, endurance, attention span~~  
~~Cooks and plates the food~~
 
~~Food prep prepares one course ahead of the course the cook is cooking~~
 
~~How do I make this exciting?~~  
~~Can go course by course <- will take too long~~  
~~Prep and cook all the courses pretty much at the same time~~  
~~Plating the courses~~  
~~Instead of giving each character a different role in the kitchen,~~  
~~(a) Give each character the chance to prepare some part of the meal~~  
~~or~~  
~~(b) Rotate the characters job positions throughout the meal~~
   

**This isn't just for challenging the character sheet**
 
How do?  
Instead of having a set menu, tell the players this is a well stocked kitchen with many ingredients available, but refuse to say which. As the characters reach for one, tell them it is there. The players will come up with their own menu, but lead them to believe this is the menu that the chef had in mind. This will simulate the characters already knowing what the menu is. Have the characters work together as a team to complete each course.  
If the players have a hard time figuring out what to make for a given course, mark off a failure and have the Chef yell at the characters what to make for the course, referring to The Meal section.  
(?) Skill Challenge: need 12 successes (1 for each course) before 3 failures. If the team fails, Chef Ramski attacks the party.  
The party member that rolls for a given course is the one that takes the lead for that course. Have the player announce what they will be preparing, then roll to see if they can find the correct ingredients and how well they can put them together.
