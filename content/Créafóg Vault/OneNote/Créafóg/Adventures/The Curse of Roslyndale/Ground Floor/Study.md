Time Dilation: 10
 
Book shelves have a locked cage in front of them.
 
As you step into the room, you hear a k-tik as the door closes gently behind you. **[The door is locked and jammed and can't be picked]** The left wall is lined with books and a weathered roll top desk sits centered on the right side of the room. A large bay window on the wall directly in front of you. Framing the desk are three beautifully painted pictures. The large painted on the left depicts Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface. The large painting on the right is of Minuris shining resplendently in the midnight sky. The trees beneath her gleaming rays glowing majestically. The long landscaped painting bridging the two behind the desk limns Veraudinaus standing handsome and proud at his zenith in the sky, raining down heavenly light illuminating a magnificent town beneath. The floor is elegantly inlaid with **different types of wood** and on the ceiling crawls delicately carved crossbeams.
 
Lightning sprints across the sky just above the estate **kouphhhh** the sound of thunder almost deafening. The drumming of the rain becomes heavier and heavier. As the bay window begins to leak, you look down and find yourself standing in low water. Looking behind you, the door is also leaking. Water spews from the books, from the paintings. The room is quickly filling, as the water level rises. **Hey google, start a five minute timer**. What do you do?
 9. Water rises up to Allanon's knees
10. Now it is as high as his stomach
11. As the water rises to Allanon's shoulders, Yg and Roscey's feet lift off the floor.
12. Allanon's feet lift off the floor as the water level reach Dampe's shoulders.
13. The water continues to rise to the ceiling. You have to smash your face against the cross beams just to continue breathing.

**When Allanon shifts read the following:**  
_Conjuring the image of the animal in your mind, you reach down through the roots of your consciousness into that place within you where your magic rests. You pause as you search around a moment. You find nothing. You realize there is no well of magic. Your connection is completely gone. You open your eyes a human._
 
After a few moments, your release the last of your breath, and your arms go slack. Yg and Roscey first. Then Dampe. Finally Allanon. One by one each of you begins to lose consciousness. You feel yourselves descend slowly towards the floor.
 
Landing gently, your bodies righting themselves feet down, you look around the room. The left wall is lined with books and a desk sits centered on the right side of the room. A large bay window on the wall directly in front of you. Framing the desk are three beautifully painted pictures. The large painted on the left depicts Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface. The large painting on the right is of Minuris shining resplendantly in the midnight sky. The trees beneath her gleaming rays glowing majestically. The long lanscaped painting bridging the two behind the desk limns Veraudinaus standing handsome and proud at his zenith in the sky, raining down heavenly light illuminating a magnificent town beneath. The floor is elegantly inlaid with different types of wood and on the ceiling crawls delicately carved crossbeams.
