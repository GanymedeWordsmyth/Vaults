+2 Greatsword forged with dark magic and mimic blood, giving it a toothy maw incorporated into its blade.  
In place of an attack, you can have the sword make a bite attack, which deals 2d12 piercing damage and grapples a medium or smaller creature on a hit (escape DC17)  
If you have a creature grappled in this way, you can't use the sword to make attacks, except for more bite attacks against the grappled creature  
As an action, you can command the blade to swallow the creature its grappling, which must make a DC17 Dex save or be sucked into the sword's stomach, which exists on a demiplane. On a successful save, the creature is no longer grappled.  
While swallowed, a creature is blinded and restrained, and takes 10d6 acid damage at the start of each of your turns. If the creature deals 50 damage or more to the wall of the stomach in a single turn, the sword regurgitates it, and it langs prone in a space within 5 feet of you. If the creature dies in the stomach, you gain 2d12 temporary hit points.  
Once the sword successfully swallows a creature, you can't use this feature again until the next dawn.
