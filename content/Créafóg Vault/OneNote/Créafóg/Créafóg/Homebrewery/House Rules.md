# House Rules
 
## Arcane Healing Spells  
All arcane spellcasters have access to all hp healing spells. Whenever a divine caster casts a healing spell, they pray to their deity and that being comes down and heals the creature receiving the healing. This is not true for an arcane spellcaster. There is no god that does the hard work for you. Unless the spell is already on the arcane caster's class spell list, after an arcane spellcaster casts a healing spell, the spellcaster must make a medicine check where the DC equals 10 + the spell's level at which it is being cast. On a success, the arcane caster is able to see the extent of the damage and the spell succeeds. Otherwise, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.
 
## Broken Weapons and Armor  
Whenever a creature wielding a melee or ranged weapon rolls a natural 1, that weapon suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If the penalty drops to -5, the weapon is rendered useless until repaired. When someone lands a critical hit, the receiving creature's armor suffers a cumulative -1 to AC. The armor is rendered useless until repaired if the penalty reduces its AC equal to the creature's AC without armor.
 
When paying to get the armor or weapon repaired, decreasing the penalty by 1 costs a third of the price of a brand new version of that weapon or piece of armor.
 
You also have the option of repairing your broken equipment yourself. You must be proficient in and have access to the appropriate tool to attempt this, i.e. smith's tools for metal armor and weapons, or leatherworker's tools for padded or leather armor. The DC to reduce the penalty by 1 is 10 + the total reduction

## Character Creation  
When creating a new character:  
- Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest  
- Reroll 1s, keep rerolling until it's not a 1  
- Reroll any stats less than 8  
- After you all six stats, add all of the modifiers. If that number is less than +2, reroll all stats.  
- If there are less than two 15s, reroll all stats   After creating your character, write five rumors about their reputation: two positive, two negative, and one false and give these rumors to me! More than five rumors are more than welcome! Throughout the campaign, whenever the party is around a rumormill, I'll likely pass out a couple of the rumors without saying whether it's true or false
 
## Humans  
Humans in my setting have the innate ability to sense the presence of magic. Whenever a human is within 30 feet of a magical source, they can smell an ambient smell of ozone with no apparent point of origin.
 
## Minions  
Minions are exactly like the normal monster with the same AC, to hit and damage bonuses, and other stats, except they only have 1hp. If the minion is subjected to an effect where it has to make a save to take half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds, and dies if it fails. A minion is worth one tenth the XP of the normal monster.

## Training  
When learning how to become proficient in using a new tool or speaking a new language, roll your character's initial aptitude for learning, modifying your roll with your character's Intelligence modifier and the appropriate modifiers listed below. Scholarly characters, such as sage's and wizards, add their profiency bonus as they are accustomed to studying and learning new things.
 
Learning a tool requires access to that tool while studying it, whether your character is renting the tool or owns it outright, and either a journal, a learning book, or a teacher to learn from during the time of study. Renting a tool costs a third of the price of the tool per hour. Every hour of study with the tool, whether it's being rented or owned, costs 5gp to experiment with and learn how the materials and ingredients go together. Learning a language requires your character to seek out a teacher or having another party member be willing to teach your character.
 
Using someone's personal journal grants +2 to aptitude checks, including the initial aptitude check, but must be found, stolen, or freely given to your character, having a learning book grants a +4 but costs 25gp to purchase or 10gp per hour to rent, and finding a teacher grants +6 but costs 15gp per hour and your character must be with the teacher for at least 4 cumulative hours to utilize this bonus.
 
If another party member is willing to teach your character the new tool or language, that party member must first be proficient in that tool or be able to speak that language and you must spend all 5 hours with that party member uninterupted. That party member can charge whatever they wish per hour, including free.
 
After 5 uninterupted hours of teaching your character, the player of that party member must make an aptitude check for their character to see how well they were able to portray their knowledge to your character. If they roll a 10 or above, then you make your character's aptitude check as noraml. If they rolled above a 20, you roll with advantage. If they rolled below 10, roll with disadvantage. If they rolled below a 5, they have failed to teach your character anything and the 5 hours of uninterupted study was wasted.
 
After every 5 cumulative hours of study (or uninterupted study with a fellow party member), make an aptitude check for your character. On a failed check against the DC's described in the Aptitude Check Table, your character didn't make any advancement in their understanding and must study for another 5 hours before making another aptitude check.
 
If you fail by more than 5 on your character's aptitude check, something breaks during experimentation and must be replaced or repaired for a quarter of the price of the tool before you can continue to study it. If you roll a Natural 1 on your character's aptitude check, the tool is destroyed and must be replaced outright before you can continue to study it. If you utilized a teacher and roll a Natural 1, your character must either find a new teacher or pay them double to utilize their services in the future.
 
Succeeding by more than 5 on an aptitude check counts as 2 successes. If you had a teacher, they will give you your next lesson free. Rolling a Natural 20 on your character's aptitude check counts as 3 successes. If you had a teacher, they will give you your next two lessons free.
 
After your character has succeeded on enough checks, he or she can add that tool or language to their proficiencies.
