A little more wealthy. In this house can be found the key to the church (Key with a handle in the shape of a triskelion, **picture saved in Curse of Roslyndale folder**). This is the house of one of the clergy. The wisp from the previous house disappears "into" this one.
 
Key with a triskelion shaped handle is found in the lockbox in the back closet.
 
A residual haunting can be observed here wandering through the house and a second one making food.

- The one making food is activated by entering the kitchen and is very angry at the interruption. Anyone that witnesses the haunting makes a DC13 Wisdom save or be shaken for 10 minutes. A shaken creature takes a -2 penalty to any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes.
- The wandering residual haunting will point them in the direction of the key.
- A poltergeist also roams around the clergy house protecting the key. If they stay away from the key, the poltergeist is just a prankster. Pulling shit off the shelves, etc. If they find the closet, and as long as they possess the key, the poltergeist will attack them. If they start a downward spiral, have a wisp show up and attack the poltergeist.
 
Okay so we have three ghosts here: the mother cooking, pissed off at all the interruptions, the father/clergyman protecting the key, and the daughter, who is a wisp (remember the wisp children can change their apparent form between invisible, a flame, and a transparent child that looks like they did in life), leading them towards the key.
 
In the daughter's room is the leathery body of a once sleeping girl.  
In the main bedroom are the leathery bodies of the clergyman and his wife.  
In the closets are rotten personal affects
 
Girl jumps into chest and slams it shut in the vision.
