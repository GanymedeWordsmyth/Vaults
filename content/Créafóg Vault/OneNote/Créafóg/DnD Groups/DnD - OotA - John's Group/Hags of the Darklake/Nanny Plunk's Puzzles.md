First contact:  
<very witchy voice> Oooh hello there! I believe this is our first meeting. I am known by many names by many people. But, you may know me as Nanny Plunk. And who might you be? ___ [Hemeth steps into view] Oh now there is a familiar face. Hello again, how was the village? I heard you had a rather fun time there.
 
<Hemeth grumbles at the question>
 
One of them explains that Plunk loves riddles, puzzles, and games. Failure or trying to find a way around the games is not a good idea.
 
The riddle of the locks:
 
A soldier is trapped  
Deep, deep under the ground  
Her sweat turns to ice  
A cold rush of air freezing her face  
Ray of Frost  
This tone she'll hear  
With the cold death near  
When this bell tolls  
She knows she's about to lose her soul  
Toll the Dead  
A touch from death  
Cold as ice  
A skeletal hand  
Her soul's the price  
Chill Touch  
For those who are lost  
As most souls are  
The pale rider comes  
To give this to her  
Guidance  
Stronger than stone  
Stronger even than steel  
Yet speaking its name spells its destruction  
Without this her soul will wander forever  
Silence
