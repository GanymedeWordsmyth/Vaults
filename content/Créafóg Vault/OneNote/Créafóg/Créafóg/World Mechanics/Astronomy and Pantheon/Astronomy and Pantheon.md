Update: 15Mar24:  
Calendar:  
Two moons, Aide and Minuris, one sun, eldest brother Veraudinus.  
So that would mean the lunar calendar would account for the phases of both moons. Each moon spins and orbits at a different rate. Each month would line up with the orbit of the faster moon. Each season would line up with the orbit of the slower moon. And then each year would line up with the sun.  
~~Okay, each moon is divided into four phases: full, waning half, new, waxing half~~  
5 slower full moons per year  
Aide (Goddess of magic) and Minuris (god of binding and spells) are twins  
Aide is the smaller, faster moon. Minuris is the larger, slower moon.  
How many Aide phases are in one Minuris phase? One year is defined as one full orbit of the planet around Veraudinus, one month is defined as one Aide orbit per year. Each season is defined as one Minuris orbit, there are 5 Minuris orbits per year.  
Each month being defined as a full orbit of Aide means that each week starts with a different moon phase: full, waning half, new, waxing half  
Each season being defined as a full orbit of Minuris means that each season would have 4 months: full, waning half, new, waxing half  
How do they know when a full planetary orbit is? They don't know exactly when a full planetary orbit is. The more easily observed astral phenomenon is seeing that about 5 Minuris orbits brings frost and so on. This would mean that they don’t track planetary orbits which would also mean that the Minuris orbits don't line up perfectly and there would need to be leap days to make up the difference.  
Actually, I like the idea better that one year is just under 5 Minuris orbits, which would require days to be taken away from the year.
