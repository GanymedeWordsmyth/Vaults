Vawdrey Knights:  
Fearthainne Solasta and Coillte (Wood Elf Druid, uncorrupted, Rybeth)  
Urraim Sealgair (Human Hell Knight (See Conquest Paladin, XGtE37) turned Death Knight, Nirani)  
Secretly burning down the small village **of great significance to Urraim**, Frik had lied to Sealgair saying that **someone else** did it and that the two of them should take care of the problem. The other Knights need not know. While on the journey, Plabàs visited Urraim's dreams and slowly corrupted the Knight.  
The small towns around Marwolaeth are populated by the undead. Some even of Nirani  
Plabàs Frik (Human **Dream Druid or Enchanter** turned Lich, Baile final BBEG)  
The First to be corrupted, and by far the most powerful of the former Vawdrey Knights, Plabàs Frik spends most of him time pouring over his studies in his laboratory deep, deep within his Labyrinthine maze.  
Having already corrupted Sealgair, Frik only has two more Knights to corrupt before unleashing hell on Créafóg starting with Fearthainne Solasta. However, the steadfast minds of the Wood Elves are far less corruptible than humans.  
Grutok the Brutal (Goliath Barbarian, Erolyn)  
Keeping the peace between all the tribes of the nation of Thadrinnor
 
Hags of the Dreadmire (Human Archfey Warlock turned into a coven of hags, Aladewyr)  
Were once a single person who signed her soul to **An Archfey**, she was tricked by Frik into betraying the fickle Archfey and was smote into three Hags as punishment for her crimes.  
Granny Gretta Greenteeth  
Night Hag, Erolyn  
One of the first creatures to come through the gate above the Ziggurat  
Corrupted orcs in Thadrinnor to attack and weaken Erolyn and overthrow Grutok the Brutal  
Whence this will make it so she has control over Thadrinnor and can further her goals  
Wants to summon (Tarrasque, Nightwalker, or some other powerful beastie)
