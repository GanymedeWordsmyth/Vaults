## Ethical and Legal Considerations
Permission to perform actions related to this field needs to be explicitly given in written consent in the form of a Scope of Work (including a detailed scope of testing, contract, and rules of engagement) signed by both parties. Otherwise, performing ANY scanning or activities that interact with `ANY` of an organization's systems is against the law and could lead to legal and even criminal action being taken against you.

For practice on real-world targets, you can leverage bug hunting programs hosted by organizations such as [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/directory/programs) and [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/programs). Keep in mind that even these companies have their own scope and rules of engagement, so make sure to familiarize yourself with them before starting any testing activities. Most of them do not allow automated scanning, which makes them a great way to practice and hone your info gathering and manual web app testing skills.

>[!Note] Important Note
>Once you land you first pentesting job, do your due diligence to ensure that the company is a legitimate organization performing assessments only after explicit coordination (and contract paperwork) is completed between the target company and client. While rare, there are some criminal organizations that pose as legitimate companies to recruit talent to assist in illegal actions.
>Make sure that you have a copy of the signed scope of work/contract and a formal document listing the scope of testing (URLs, individual IP addresses, CIDR network ranges, wireless SSIDs, facilities for a physical assessment, or lists of email or phone numbers for social engineering engagements), also signed by the client.
>While testing, *stay within the scope of testing*. Do not stray from the scope if you notice other IP addresses or subdomains that look more interesting. *If in doubt, reach out* to the client. It's possible the client forgot to add certain hosts to the scoping test, or didn't know to even include them. Make sure to get the appended scope *in writing*.

Work under the guiding principle of `do no harm` and strive to perform all testing activities in a careful and measured way. You will become highly skilled at doing this and great trust will be placed on you. *Do not abuse this trust.* If you work *ethically* and *within the bounds of the law*, you will have a long and fruitful career and make great business and personal relationships along the way. *Document Everything*. When in doubt, document and overcommunicate. Ensure that all the "boring" compliance issues are taken care of first so you can rest easy and enjoy performing excellent comprehensive assessments for your clients as their trusted advisor.

# Steps of Engagement
## Pre-Engagement
![[Pasted image 20240425000634.png]]
The pre-engagement stage is where the main commitments, tasks, scope, limitations, and related agreements are documented *in writing*. During this stage, contractual docs are drawn up, and essential info is exchanged that is relevant for pentesters and the client, depending on the type of assessment.
## Information Gathering
The next step, and the only step you can take from the pre-engagement, is the `Info Gathering` stage. Before any target systems can be examined and attacked, we must first identify them. It may well be that the customer will not give any info about the network and components other than a domain name or just a listing of in-scope IP address/network ranges. Therefore, we need to get an overview of the target web app(s) or network before proceeding further.
