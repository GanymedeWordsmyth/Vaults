The World of the Ancients was the first world. It was Créafóg when the gods and titans still roamed. The end of the World of the Ancients started with the creation of thinking creatures.
 
The Titans were formed from the Void, the Titans created the Gods, the Gods created thinking creatures
 
What was created from the void:  
Titans, elements, cosmology  
What was created by the titans:  
Gods, planets, inner and outer planes of existence  
What was created by the Gods:  
Living creatures, thinking creatures
 
Each plane of existence was created by a Titan  
As an example Mechanus was created by the Titan Primus, who has since perished. The residents, who are to this day unable to operate without a Primus, promoted the highest ranking modron to be the new Primus. No gods were created to rule here.  
Conversely in the Nine Hells, the Titan, who's name is known by very few, created the first Arch Devils, Asmodeus quickly rose to the top and now reigns supreme as the overlord of the Nine Hells. Some rose to power as well and currently hold their position. Then there were those who didn't make the cut. These ones rose to power, then were quickly knocked off their thrones by their subordinates who now hold said thrones.
 
The inner planes, specifically the Prime Material Plane are the only places the have Gods as we understand them.
