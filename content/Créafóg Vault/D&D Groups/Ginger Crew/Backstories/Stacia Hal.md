###### As played by Stephanie Petillo
Half-orc coyote of smoke barbarian/wizard
Related to Egordo Ruhk the Filthy.
Why is she allowed to call him Egordo?
	Maybe she was his prized mule
	In this case, he probably was not happy that she escaped.
	Oh, actually, what if he believes she was stolen
	Either way, she was allowed to live in his home and was raised as close to "as his child" as a half breed could be.
	This would mean that she was raised to fight (hence the barbarian)
