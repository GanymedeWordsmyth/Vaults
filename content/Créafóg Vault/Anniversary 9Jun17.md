31Mar17 oldest note in the book, consisting of my magician stuff

15May17 just found two notes from May 15th, 2017. These consist of when I first bought and started reading and taking notes of Out of the Abyss.

24May17 started my journey as a DM. The oldest note I have is under the "Becoming a DM" section of my notebook titled, "What kind of game do I run?" And consists of the following notes:
	 > Life is cheap
		Don't get attached until 3rd or 5th level
	> Can only level up when you get "back to town"
	> Players and the players' character are two different people
		Just because someone's character does something, that doesn't mean the player did it.
	> That being said, always try to emphasize if it's you talking/acting or your PC talking/acting and don't be a wangrod
	> Keep the metagaming to a minimum
	> Players keep track of damage against monsters??
	> Players recap not DM
	> Players run their own ship. It's up to the player to know how to run their character
	> I run games with moral ambiguity. I do not assume the motivations of your characters.
	> Hit points: When hit by an attack, you must spend hit points to not die. When you are out of hit points, or an attack is greater than your remaining hit points, the next attack is a fatal attack

25May17 was the very first note in the Créafóg notebook titled, "Low Level Hooks." It sat for about 15 days with nothing else in it. I think this was the time that I was consuming a lot of D&D content and media, specifically from Matt Colville:
	Dungeon Delve
	~~The Crucible of Freya
	The Keep on the Borderlands
	Keep on the Shadowfell (lvl 5)
	The Moathouse dungeon from the Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil for T1
	T1 The Village of Hommlet
	Against the Cult of the Reptile God~~
	Kalarel the Vile

9Jun17 was the first day I started filling in notes and made a ton of entries between the 9th and the 10th. It probably makes the most sense to make the 9th of June my Créafóg anniversary day

27May18 was the day that I created my Player Primer
