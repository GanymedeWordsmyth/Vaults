Dybbuks are native to the astral plane and classified as fiend (astral). Their main drive is corrupting consecrated holy places  
Shadow horrors are of liberi temporis heritage. The tempus cari are time healers, whereas these guys clear areas infested by time destroyers before giving the all clear for the squishier tempus cari come in to work on the broken time. Being not very intelligent, life is more black and white to them. They have a basic, animalistic understand the difference between friend and foe, but that's it. The party will be seen as a threat unless they do something clever to show they aren't.  
The church is not safe for the tempus cari, so they are absent here. If the party visited the graveyard before this, they may have had the opportunity to encounter the tempus cari there. If the party decided to help them, or otherwise not attack, the tempus cari, knowing the tutelae are elsewhere in the town, would bestow upon them something to make the tutelae not harmful to the party.
 
Order of operations:

**If at any point they return to the sanctuary, the sanctuary encounter replays from the beginning.**
 
**Even if they enter from a different entrance from the vestibule, they still enter from the vestibule entrance.**
 
Sanctuary encounter:  
You come to a large **[locked]** elegantly carved door. Contrary to the surroundings, this door is as bright and new as the day it was finished and installed. **This door cannot be picked.**
 
You place the key you found into the lock and it turns freely and the door opens into the church's sanctuary. As you walk in, you all see an elegant arrangement of marble columns and granite surfaces. The walls are outlined with a fine golden trim. Cherry wood pews line the atrium up to the raised dais framed by a low white ash wood fence and upon the dais sits an alter in the middle and a lectern on the left and right sides. Above the dais is a tall stain glass dome depicting Aelus **(who is Aelus?)** through which the sun shines brilliantly, bouncing off the lightly colored walls and golden trim lighting the interior.
 
For Allanon, you smell and faint smell of ozone as a woman **[Eleanor Cotton]** approaches you, "That was very kind of you to join us for the funeral during this time of morning. Come, come. Sit with me and my husband. Are you friends of Mistress Lackman?" **[take a few minutes to rp this out a bit]** As you talk, she leads you over to one of the pews where a man sits near the middle. "Henry **[Cotton]**," she says to the man quietly as he stares solemnly towards the woman in black, not acknowledging his wife, "these are friends of the Lackman family, Allanon, Dampé, you said Yg, was it? Kothar, and Falcon. They've come to pay their respects." **[even if they don't call themselves friends, she still says they are. Also, she still introduces everyone even if they didn't all follow.]**
 
The pastor continues his speech as you look around and see a few other villagers. In the front row is the woman you met from earlier sitting in a black veil and dress. Next to her sits a man dressed in a well made suit **[this is the same man from the mirror in Dampé's dream]**. What do you do?
 
Guardian Emblem hidden somewhere?
 
Second floor encounter:  
Around the table are Hiroshima ghosts along the table itself and the floor. Roll initiative. After the fight the party hears the church bell sound above them
 
Bell tower encounter:  
In this tower hangs a thick rope. If it's pulled, the bell sounds a mighty gong. Looking out to the east, you see what looks to be a floating, ethereal jellyfish rising and sinking serenely in the air.
 
Pastor encounter:  
A man in vestiges writes furiously at a desk. He doesn't seem to know you are there. As you walk forward, his heads shoots up and his eyes connect with yours as you feel a chill shoot down your spine. You blink and he is gone for an instant before grabbing your arm from behind and staring intently through your eyes, "evil infests this Godly town!" His voice booms with multiple coinciding tones. You take 1d10 necrotic damage as you feel his cold hand chill you to your bones. You look down in panic as you feel your muscles wither. You age 1d6 years. Looking back up at him he has vanished.
 
Shack/basement/nun encounter:  
As you descend the staircase after the children, you hear an elderly woman scold the children for being outside with "those creatures."  
Nun knowledge:  
Don't know what's happening or where the creatures came from.  
Thinks they came from the graveyard  
On a downbeat, a pack of wolves with rotting flesh storm down the staircase and block the exit.  
As a wolf is destroyed, it ragdolls away as a jellyfish creature now floats in the space the wolf was originally in. **On the dybbuks next turn, it rises slowly through the ceiling. Don't forget to ungroup the wolf and dybbuk**  
When the characters look back after defeating the wolves, the nun and the children are gone. All that's there are small blue flames floating gently in the children's place. Roll initiative again to fight the wisps
 
Ambush:  
Leaving the basement, the party encounters 1d4 dybbuk humanoid corpses and 1d4+1 dybbuk dog corpses. One of the dybbuks attacking the party animated Beatrice's corpse
