You awaken deep within a dark forest. A low ambient light pervades the wood, only enough to make out shapes and silhouettes. The smell of moss and ferns fill your sinuses. A woman's voice enters your mind, low pitched and soft, "don't wake up. Whatever you do, don't wake up. We're going through the forest now. Be calm_._ Don't make a sound. _Don't wake up._ Don't move. _Don't wake up._ I can ensure your safe passage, but only if you listen carefully and do exactly as I say."  
ï¿¼What do you do?
 
The voice continues, "If anything tries to look at you, do not meet its eye. _Don't wake up._ If anyone tells you to wake up, even me, don't listen. _Don't wake up._ We'll get through this." As you walk you look around into the blinding darkness, at the trees still standing, at those no longer, at the dirt beneath the woman continues with a warning, "their eyes are open, now close yours!"
 
_Wake up._ Says the woman
 
_Yoo-hoo, over here darling_ What do you do?  
When you look, you see a carving of a statue, _wake up_ another feminine voice swoons
 
"We have to get you out of here. Close your eyes. Don't wake up!"
 
A different woman's voice comes through. Recognizable. The voice of your mother as you feel fingers move gently through your hair, "it's time to wake up sweetie."
