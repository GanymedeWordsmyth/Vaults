Wispmother dreams  
Dampé  
You awaken in a dark liminal space. You can barely make out any details in the distance. A hooded figure in black robes holding scales palm down with a skeletal hand steps into view and calmly approaches you. An ornate breastplate peaks through the folds and a long pewter greatsword hangs loosely across the figures back. He extends another skeletal hand out of the left side of his robes as if to beckon for yours. Do you take it?
 
You take the figures hand and the two of you face forward and the figure raises the scales as the darkness dissolves away. You look to your right and the figure is gone and the hand you were holding gone as well.
 
Looking forward again, you stand at the entrance to a ruined town. As you look around you notice it is completely barren and in disarray. It is cold, and dark with a faint bit of moon light shining from the two moons, Aide and Minuris. A low fog hangs over the desolate town, heavy, yet transparent. There is a faint noise in the distance, rhythmic and chaotic. You are too far away to be able to identify it.
 
You watch a board drop off from one of the windows of a boarded up house. Looking back up, you find yourself standing in the middle of a graveyard where you see a walking circle around dead cherry tree. Leading away from the tree are three paths in three different directions. Looking down each path, you can see a statue down the first, a clearing down the second, and a Mausoleum down the third. The rhythmic sound you heard at the entrance of the town resonates off the tombstones, louder than before but still too far to identify. Which path do you take?
 
- Statue path
- Clearing path
- Mausoleum path

You arrive at the marble statue depicting a woman clutching three children tightly, her face contorted in anguish. Tears of blood stream down the statue's face. You hear from the woman rhythmic wails and sobs. It's the same sound you've been hearing since you arrived. There is a plaque at the base of the statue that's hard to read. You move closer to the statue to inspect it further and a single blue flame emerges by one of the children. Then another. And a third. You are taken aback as the three flames dance around the statue. You raise your arm towards them and the flames stop dancing and shift aggressively towards you before charging in your direction their light blinding you for a moment. When your eyes finally refocus, …  
You arrive standing in the middle of a clearing in the graveyard. There are no trees. There are no tombstones. As you focus and look around you see a circle of some kind drawn on the ground glowing a faint amber glow. Gossamers of smoke rise from four points around the circle as you hear shouting, "This is a terrible idea Mistress. Bringing people back is tremendously dangerous!" calls an elderly man.  
"I care not for the consequences Mr Cotton. I paid you your price and you will obey. Or do I need to send word to the Sovereign Concordat?" snaps the woman in a threatening manner.￼"No Mistress, I will complete the ritual." He acquiesces.  
You hear chanting as the smoke becomes thicker and heavier. A strong wind starts to whip, kicking up dirt and leaves, causing you to instinctually put your arms up defensively, averting your eyes. When you put your arms down and open your eyes, …  
You arrive at the mausoleum and can see a name above the door, but it is out of focus and hard to read. You step through into the mausoleum and find yourself in a small marble room. In the center of the room is a black stone statue of a robed figure wearing a long beaked mask. In the crook of the figure's arm rests a winged staff with two snakes coiling around the middle. The figure's thumbs, first fingers, and pinkies touch at the tips and the middle and ring fingers are curled in so they touch at the first knuckle.
 
The three walls recess to form three shelves. On the left shelf rests an urn depicting Aide rising over the bay, her brilliant light reflecting off the water's surface and a small wooden doll carved out of walnut. The shelf on the back wall hosts an urn depicting Veraudinus, the sun, at his zenith shining gloriously down over the world and a child sized wooden sword and bow both carved out of maple. In the shelf on the right sits an urn depicting Minuris shining resplendently in the midnight sky. Next to this urn sits a marionette carved from ash wood. **(DC12 nature check reveals that these woods represents different aspects of the spiritual world.)** You hear a woman crying behind you through the door. The rhythm is the same as the rhythm you heard when you first entered the town and again when you arrived in the graveyard. You walk through the door and find …
 
… you are in a hallway with three doors on each side, each framing a moderately sized bust mirror in between them. There is a staircase behind you leading to the front door. The door at the end of the hall slowly creaks open, the sound of a crying woman resounding from within. What do you do? **(the other doors are locked. If she tries to leave, read the following:**  
You take a step down the staircase to your right and you hear a soft masculine voice in your ear, "Now, now Mistress. We need to get you to bed."  
"But that's where they…" You can't finish your sentence before a small whimper leaves your lips.
 
You glance into one of the mirrors as you walk towards the door and see the reflection of a man in the mirror put an arm around your shoulder as deafening wails of grief explode out from behind your lips. You look back towards the door and your hands come up and meet your face as you continue to sob into them. You continue forward, ever walking. Towards the door. It seems like an eternity. Your grief is endless. Immeasurable. Finally you reach the door and as soon as you touch it, all is quiet. The man is gone, your clothes are your own. You are your own. You take a second to ground yourself before entering the room. You push silently into the room and see a woman crying in a corner arms outstretched onto an elegant four post bed. Over the bed hovers three distinct blue flames. She also glows a faint bluish hue. What do you do?
 
**Turn back:** you turn slowly and step carefully towards the door and a board creaks under your weight and the door snaps shut in an instant. You look back in terror she is staring furiously, …
 
**Continue forward:** you step forward and as a board creaks under your weight, her head shoots furiously in your direction, …
 
… staring into your soul for but a moment before she cries a blood curdling wail! She raises and sweeps her hand and even though she's across the room, you feel a force thrust you into the nearby closet and the door slams shut. The darkness slowly suffocating, the walls shrinking ever towards you until finally a hand reaches through the door, through your flesh and into your chest and you feel her grasp you heart in her hand. Fingers and nails long and sharp you feel them dig slowly into your heart as she shrieks, "You are mine!" You awaken gasping for breath, your head pounding as though you've been holding your breath for far too long you grasp at your heart scrambling to find its beat and you feel nothing. You rip your shirt open and look down. There upon your chest, right where your heart is, lies a bruise in the shape of a hand print. As you place your hand upon the bruise a horrible pain shoots through your entire body and you convulse backwards, the back of your head plows into the pillow and all goes black.

As you lie in bed, eyes closed, you feel its beat. Slow, rhythmic. You are left with two words stuck in your head that you know to be from Kelemvor: Bring Peace
