**Witch Sense:**
	Witch hunters are gifted with an innate ability to sense sorcerers. At 3rd level, you gain the "Favored Enemy" and "Primeval Awareness" features choosing "sorcerer" as the choice. You get these even if you took the optional features from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. Additionally, after observing someone for at least 1 minute, you can make a Charisma (Insight) check to discern whether someone is a sorcerer.

**Hunter's Technique (3rd level)** 
	Witch hunters have many methods by which they hunt sorcerers. Most have their own preferred method that they hone over the course of their careers. At 3rd level, you choose which one of the following methods works best for you:
	**Alchemist:** bombs, oils, potions, and poisons you create are more potent and last longer. Whenever you use an alchemical solution, you can expend a spell slot while creating a solution to either increase it's duration or damage. Alchemical solutions that don't do damage or have a during of instantaneous are unaffected and you must choose to increase the other aspect. The number you increase the aspect by equals half you witch hunter level multiplied by the level of spell slot expended. When increasing duration, you keep the time used in the duration description i.e. if the duration is counted in minutes, you increase the duration by that many minutes.
	**Spell Slinger:** Choose 3 1st level spells from either the druid or ranger class. Two of which must be from the abjuration or the evocation schools. These spells count as ranger spells for you, but do not count against your spells known. Any time you level up in this class, you can change one of the spells gained by this feature. Additionally, you can cast one of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you do this, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.
	**Martial Adept:** Whenever you hit an enemy with a melee or ranged weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot to do extra damage. The damage dealt is a number of d6's equal to half you ranger level, rounded up, multiplied by the level of spell slot you expended.
**Note: work in that prot from evil and good includes sorcerers** (Maybe they are elementals/aburations/etc?)
**Practiced alchemy:**
	Starting at 3rd level, you learn the following alchemical recipes:
		Learn potions and poisons to help:
		Bombs of poison spray, produce flame (can only be used to attack)
		Oils of mold earth (can only be used to cast the third option), shillelagh
		Potions of guidance, light, hunter's sense, primal savagery, resistance
		Poisons of cause fear, inflict wounds, mind sliver, sapping sting, (ray of) sickness 

**Hexbane Defense** 
	You have become such an accomplished hunter, that you can read the actions of foes to predict what comes next. At 7th level you gain one of the following abilities:
	**Hunter's Insight:** You can take a full turn to observe an enemy. When you do, you can discern what the enemy will do on their *not powerful enough. I like it, but need more*
	In addition, you take the dodge action. 
	**Interuptions:** when you are in melee with an enemy, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack even if they teleport away from you. If you are attacking with a ranged weapon when the enemy teleports, you can use your reaction to hit them with that weapon before they teleport. If the attack hits, the teleport fails and is wasted.
	**Need one more option:** 

**Level 11 feature**
	**Greater Alchemy:** (1st, 2nd, 3rd level spells as alchemy)
	**Greater Spell Slinger:** 
	**Greater Martial Adept:** 

**Level 15 feature** 
	

Ranger archetype feature levels: 3, 7, 11, 15
Options: alchemist (spell slots fuel potions and poisons), spell slinger (gain certain spells that can be cast either for free or cheaper, abjuration and evocation), martial mastery (spell slots fuel attacks)
For any list the includes a number of creatures to choose from, detect, or affect, add sorcerer to that list.
Can use reaction for opportunity attack against someone within melee who is attempting to warp away (misty step, teleport, etc)

Old notes:
	Witch hunter options should basically be the different methods one would choose for how they hunt witches. This would probably be loosely based on the Witcher series. I think this would also be a martial third-caster class. Similar to the eldritch knight, except casting is a part of the core class, not just the subclass.
	Oh wait, this would perfectly fit under the ranger subclass, or reflavored. Rangers are hunters that track a specific enemy. So just make a ~~bunch of ranger subclasses~~ ranger subclass called the "Witch Hunter" and have a bunch of tertiary options like the totem barbarian.
	Core Mechanics:
	Options:
		Potion master
Old notes - this should be a class, not a background. Though there should be a background called something else for those that want to be a witch hunter without actually playing the class. Similar to how the entertainer is basically a bard's background.
	Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight
	Tool Proficiencies:
	Equipment:
	Feature:
	 Adv on initiate checks against Sorcerers
	 Can sense when a sorcerer is within 1,000 feet (smaller radius than [[Witch Hunter's Bane]])
	 After observing someone for at least one minute, make a Charisma (Insight) check against that person's Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check. Sorcerers use the Charisma (Deception) skill, everyone else uses the Charisma (Persuasion) skill. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
