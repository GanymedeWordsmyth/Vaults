##### Ground Floor Scene  
Those who failed the save immediately walk right into a thick layer of webs. Looking through the webs is very difficult as it lightly obscures everything around you, though through the webs you hear a child screaming in fright, "No! Not you too!" You hear a door open to your right and young footsteps run over to the girl, "Kitty! Kitty! You're having another phantasm! Wake up!" The second voice sounds like a younger version of the girl you met in the mausoleum.

Fight in the lower chapel  
Difficult terrain (double difficult for large creatures) because of the pews  
Melee attacks are at disadvantage due to the pews limiting movement
 
A little girl cowers in the corner. When the players enter, she calls them by name and pleads for them to save her from the spiders above. Do the PCs also get stuck in the webs? Or do I forgo the trap in favor of the narrative beat? Is there a way I can work in both? Honestly, most of the house is one giant trap and every room has something terrifying happening in it so I should probably just forgo this one.
 
Without the trap:  
Inside this room are (ash)wooden pews that line the floor and a narrow central walkway leading up to a rather large altar framed by two massive stained glass windows depicting scenes of agriculture. There can be seen three doors, one along the western wall and two along the north leading to the hallway. The entire room is covered in a thick layer of webs and the same girl (Kitty) the party saw outside can be seen in the corner away from the doors cowering in the corner, terrified. She's a little older than she was outside, maybe 4 or 6. She looks over to you and screams **something along the lines of, "First the spiders and now you!** **Why do you keep following me?!****" Except, she's just a child so find a way to say this with a child's vernacular.**  
Another girl (Frey), older, around 11 or 12, runs in from the door to the left runs over to the crying girl, shaking her awake, "Kitty! Kitty! You're having another phantasm! Wake up!"  
Spiders descend from the ceiling as the two girls fade from view, looking hungrily between each of you.  
Allanon and Yg hear hissing and clicking sounds from Dampé as she moves through the webs.  
**Turn to Dampé:** a commanding tone instinctually escapes your throat as you walk forward and up through the webs towards the spiders, entirely unhindered, the spiders hanging on every word and obeying your command.  
Dampé's command: (send this to Niki in a private message)  
I don't entirely know how Dampé would say this, but the words that seem to come from a place deep inside your soul are along the lines of: I am your Matron now. You will join my side and fight for me. You will live to serve me. You will die to protect me. These are my companions, treat them as though they are me.  
**Kitty's voice comes through the vision, "I can still see them"**
