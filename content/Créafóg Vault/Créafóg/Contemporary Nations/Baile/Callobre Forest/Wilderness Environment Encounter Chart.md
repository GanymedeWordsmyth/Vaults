> Fearthainne, the druid of the forest, has seen through Sylvan eye, the heroes and how they play with the Sylvan creatures of the forest. He becomes very curious about the heroes and wants to meet them. If he finds the heroes appealing, he will tell them of the corruption and the Great Bogthorn tree send them on a quest to find the lost Bogthorn weapons.  
> Coillte, the Faerie Dragon, is companion to Fearthainne. Plays a prank on the heroes. CR and XP depend on the prank. Start by the heroes hearing childish laughter and maybe even see a large grin (Wis (Perception) DC of 13)  
> Silver Dragon - A dense fog arises and surrounds the heroes and a humanoid with silver-blue opalescent scales appears to question the motives of the heroes.  
> Jackalwere encounter - a frail old woman approaches the encampment looking for food and shelter for the night. If the heroes take her in, she hangs out for a minute then transforms into a Jackalwere and out jumps two jackals and they attack the heroes. The Jackalwere is out on a hunt.  
> Bandits - come up with race  
> Fey pranks/games - Roll on the Fey Games table.  
> Awakened Shrubs - brought to life by a shambling mound?  
> Wisp mother - use stat block for the banshee. Looking for help from the heroes? Wisp Mothers shepherd the forsaken spirits of the damned. Both are bound and cursed to wander the forest. Maybe looking for help to break the binding and curse?

> Scouts - come up with race  
> Treants - The treants hold information about the Corruption that plague the Callobre Forest. If the players are accompanied by at least one elf, half elf, druid, ranger, Vawdrey Knight, or other forest dweller the treant(s) will make themselves known to those characters either through whispers, telepathy, etc. The treants will be hostile if the heroes are carrying anything related to fire (torches, etc), or if the heroes have stolen anything belonging to the forest. Otherwise, the treants are indifferent to the heroes presence and act as any other normal tree.  
> Centaur patrol - centaurs act as the patrol for Callobre Forest, fighting the Corruption and protecting its inhabitants. Upon seeing the heroes, the patrol will come to a halt and ask questions of them. If earned, showing a weapon of Bogthorn produces instant respect and help from the patrol. If stolen, this provokes an attack from the patrol in an attempt to retrieve what was stolen.  
> Dense fog -  
> Rockslide -  
> Forest fire -  
> As the heroes walk, they hear a soothing melody float gently through the trees. The song becomes louder and more distinct as Maltir makes his way into view. He will instantly recognize the adventurers if they picked up his affects from the catacombs and ask for his things back. He will be in awe if they become the Vawdrey knights and wield Bogthorn. This is their chance to find out more about the Bogthorn tree. He his here on business with the druid of Callobre asking for help clearing out the Moathouse and offering his services against the corruption from the world below (the ettercaps and blights).  
> Kenku thieves - the Kenku in this forest are a very roguish people. They sneak around the camp trying to steal the wealth and valuable items from the party, especially shiny gems and jewelry. A wisdom (Perception) of DC 10 from the parties sentry reveals that there are Kenku in the encampment. If the party didn't set up a watch, then the DC is 20.
