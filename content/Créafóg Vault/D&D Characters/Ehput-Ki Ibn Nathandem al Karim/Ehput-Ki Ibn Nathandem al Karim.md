## Expectation
Okay so here is what I'm thinking about how the world treats Ki: (Note: the level numbers are predictions. These events may happen before or after the listed levels)
	At first, anyone that knows him or knows of him, knows him as "that weird, eccentric old man." Yes, old man...his age changes as well. This change is imperceptible to himself as well as those that the curse grabs with him, they just see him as always being that age (aka, I'm not going to bring it up, but I'm hoping that when those around them start calling him old, the others will join in the mockery at first and then slowly realize what is happening).
	Then, Ki will start doing Ki things and binding others to his will. This will likely start being noticeable by level 6 or 7, and more widely noticeable by the end of level 7 and into level 8, when the party starts affecting more of the world around them. Him being an issue will likely be a shock to those that knew him, some not even believing the "rumors."
	When he becomes level 9 or 10 is when he will become a real big pain in the ass for the more powerful people in the world. This is when assassins will likely be sent after Ki.
	It is my hope that this slowly turns into a Light Yagami x L style struggle.
	Post level 10, it is my hope that the more powerful people of the world will not only have no choice but to notice him, but will also want him dead and he will have to contend with those people trying to kill him.
	Then this is where the curse becomes very fucked up. With his death, the curse grabs him and moves him to the next world where he "wakes up" as though from a dream where you witness your own death. Oh boy, wtf have I done...

# Ki's Story
Ki originally hailed from a 1980s-style post-cyberpunk Karim in Créafóg, where he was exiled for treasonous activities and experiments. During his travels, he encountered a nightclub owner seeking brave adventurers to find his keys. Low on money and seeing it as easy cash, Ki joined the quest. The bar owner sent the group to various locations with high-level magic, piquing Ki's interest. In the wastelands, a post-apocalyptic desert, he met others but found no key. Upon returning to the club owner, he was sent to more places, eventually reaching Barovia.

In Barovia, they faced a drawbridge they couldn't cross. Rolling his eyes, Ki used misty step to get across and discovered a large key jammed in the gears, preventing the bridge from opening. After dislodging the key, time stopped, and the club owner, revealed as Strahd Von Zarovich, one of the first vampires, appeared. He congratulated Ki and the others, seeking successors for Barovia, and offered them their own pocket plane.

"What friends?" Ki responded, "they are merely a means to an end. I have no need for them now." Strahd agreed and awarded Ki alone his own pocket plane.

Time passed, and Ki gained access to Strahd's realm, including his library and laboratory. Ki devised a plan to expedite his inheritance, which became a running joke between him and Strahd, both knowing it held a kernel of truth and was only a matter of time before it became reality.

"Hey Ki, what are you working on?"
"Oh, your death, of course. It has to be fitting for someone like you."

The day finally came when Ki attempted to poison Strahd with Demon's Tears, the most virulent poison. The victim doesn’t realize they’ve ingested it and it kills slowly over thirteen hours, with mild symptoms starting after four. There is no cure. Strahd, knowing this day would come, overtook Ki's mind. "Oh come now, Ki. Poison? This is the best you could come up with for me? I'm hurt." He then forced Ki to drink the poison. "I do hope you at least created the antidote?"

"Of course, Strahd. I found Demon's Tears to be a fitting end for you, while also leaving me an out just in case this very situation happened."

"Very good. I assume you know not only how to make the antidote but that it needs to be taken regularly. You make me proud. How about this," Strahd said, having Ki drink his first dose of the antidote. "I am going to send you to another land to retrieve something for me, just as I did with my key. There, I want you to learn firsthand techniques for properly dispatching powerful beings. Then, return to me with the head of one. Where I am sending you, there is a powerful Dragon Queen. Of course, you will have to find your own way back, but I assume that won't be too difficult for one such as yourself."
