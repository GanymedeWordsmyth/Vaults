Selene Thalor is an elegant, tall woman with a regal bearing. She has striking sapphire-blue eyes that hold the depths of ancient wisdom. Her deep midnight blue hair cascades down in soft waves to her waist, shimmering slightly like the surface of a tranquil ocean under moonlight.

Her robes are intricately designed in deep blue and silver, adorned with subtle patterns reminiscent of dragon scales. Around her neck hangs a pendant shaped like a sapphire dragon's claw clutching a crystal, symbolizing her true nature. Her long, slender fingers are often seen delicately handling ancient scrolls and tomes.
