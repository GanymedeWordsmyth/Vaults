Old Notes:
	Lord and Lady Dubh are elder elves who have not experienced their transcendence. Cedric is 457 and Mirna is 468. Contrary to what the rumors say, it was actually their parents fought at the battle for human freedom. They've tried to correct the rumors, but to no avail. So now they just allow them to persist as it really doesn't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.
