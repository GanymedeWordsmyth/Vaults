Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Insight
	Tool Proficiencies:
	Equipment:
	Feature:
		You come from a long line of Witch Hunters. Regardless of whether or not you are one, you know how to discern whether or not someone is a sorcerer. After observing someone for 1 minute you can recognize the telltale signs of Hagborns. Additionally, whenever you are in a settlement big enough to have a [[Hunter's Enclave]], you can utilize their provisions and services for the guild rates.
Old notes:
	 Adv on initiate checks against Sorcerers
	 Can sense when a sorcerer is within 1,000 feet (smaller radius than [[Witch Hunter's Bane]])
	 After observing someone for at least one minute, make a Charisma (Insight) check against that person's Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check. Sorcerers use the Charisma (Deception) skill, everyone else uses the Charisma (Persuasion) skill. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
