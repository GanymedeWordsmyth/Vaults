After the PCs go down the rope, Buppido goes next. As he descends, he starts to swing back and forth in jest, proclaiming, "Weeee." Following his lead, Ront repels next with stool on his shoulder, the rope still swinging from Buppido's childish fun. When they are near the floor, Stool makes to jump off Ront's shoulders {It jumps to the floor if no one makes to catch it}. This pushes Ront backward to within ten feet of the pool and as he hits the floor the large grey ooze surges out of the dark water. In your minds you hear, "Flesh for the Faceless Lord!" as it drags the orc to his water demise.
