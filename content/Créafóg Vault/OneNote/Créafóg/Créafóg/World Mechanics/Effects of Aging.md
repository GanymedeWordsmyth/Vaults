Everyone ages over time, either due to normal progression of time, the abnormal progression of time in another plane, or accelerated aging caused by a curse or other supernatural effect. Aging in this way can, under normal circumstances, only be reversed by means of divine intervention or very powerful magicks, such as a wish spell. However, when someone ages as a result of some magical effect (any effect that requires a saving throw, for instance) reversing the effects is much easier by use of the greater restoration spell or similar magicks.
 
Additionally, when a creature is subjected to an effect that magically ages that creature, and for every amount of time equal to 10% of a race's venerable age that passes when a creature is above their race's middle age, roll twice on the Aging Effects table, once on the Mental Aging Effects column and once on the Physical Aging Effects column. If a character exceeds the maximum lifespan for their race, they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15 + 1 per year in excess of their lifespan). On a failed save, the creature dies of natural causes in 3d100 days. A character tending to the needs of the aging creature with proficiency in the Medicine skill can use their skill in place of the aging creature's Constitution save. Repeat this check every birthday the creature has after their lifespan maximum.
