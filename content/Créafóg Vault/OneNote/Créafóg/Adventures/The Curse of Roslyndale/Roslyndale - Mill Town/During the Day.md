The town is cursed to relive its very last day and completely resets every morning. Mistress Lackman is in Mr Marlborough's shop and follows the same route eventually finding herself and Mr Cotton in her courtyard where the spell fails, blasting out and transforming the town into what is seen at night. This spell failure occurs at about 1:15am. Until then, the night is completely normal. **This also means that the residual hauntings and fights the party has resets every night.** **Additionally: any experience gained is also reset!!**
