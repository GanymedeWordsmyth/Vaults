Special Abilities  
Bonus Action  
The mistress relies heavily on raising allies to fight for her while she snipes from afar. She will use her Rise My Children every round she can to raise another wisp who she then sends forward to attack her enemies. Wisps attacking an enemy siphons some of the creature's soul into her, thereby healing some damage she has taken.  
Actions  
This Mistress will spend most of the fight sniping the party with her life drain, which reaches 20ft. If anyone gets within 10ft of the Mistress, she'll use her telekinetic thrust ability on her next turn to attempt to push the character away from her.  
Reactions  
Whenever a wisp is killed, the Mistress wails sorrowfully and terrifyingly, possibly frightening anyone in the room, including Mr. Cotton, but not her other wisps.  
At the start of battle, she raises her arms and three will-o'-wisps rise to her aid. These first three wisps are actually her children. Read the "Who's Fighting Who" sidebar to determine their disposition towards the party.  
Mr. Cotton  
Mr Cotton is a 6th-level wild mage. He will use his Tides of Chaos ability to give him adv on one of his attacks or saving throws. Immediately after which, roll on the wild magic table. He has the subtle magic, twinned spell, and seeking metamagics. If the Mistress makes an attack roll or saving throw that looks like it may be unsuccessful, Mr Cotton will use his Bend Luck feature to give her an extra 1d4 to the roll as long as he is not saving it.  
Whenever Mr Cotton uses one of his class features, metamagic options, roll on the wild magic surge table. Whenever he casts a spell, roll on the spell minor effect table to determine what, if any, flourish accompanies his spell.  
Lackman Children, each child can imbue one weapon with magical ability so that the weapon counts as a magical weapon when determining resistances and immunities so long as that child remains alive on the battlefield.  
Silifrey  
Can cast the grease spell and the fog spell once each during the fight  
Kethra  
Can use her reaction to absorb half the damage of one attack against an ally  
Branlyn  
Buffs his allies for a +2 on attack rolls and saving throws  
Will-O'-Wisps  
Wisps summoned by the Mistress stay to fight until the death. Any enemy that is disadvantaged in any way, narratively speak, not mechanically, such as restrained, prone, incapacitated, blinded or under attack by another creature, will be targeted by the wisps. Any creature that is brought to 0 hit points, but is still alive, will be prioritized by the wisps until one of them succeeds with their Consume Life ability. Make sure you describe their approach horrifically, "as the wisps descend upon your unmoving, unconscious body, you can feel their pull against your very life force." Something that will make the others aware of the urgency the downed character faces.
