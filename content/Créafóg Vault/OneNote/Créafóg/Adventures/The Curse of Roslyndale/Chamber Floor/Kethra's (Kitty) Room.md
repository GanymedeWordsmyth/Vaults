**The inspiration for the following is being drawn from a 6 episode BBC series called The Living and The Dead. From Kitty's perspective, this is their first meeting. Though, from the party's perspective, they will have met her multiple times.**
 
Kitty, throughout her life, has frequently looked into the future and past. This is something she didn't yet know about nor come to terms with. These times would often come to her as specters that stand in the corners of her room and such. Whenever the party encounters a flash back with her in it, she points to the party members and says, "there they are again."
 
The first time in her memory she saw the party was in her room. This should provide ample opportunity for the party to get used to her pointing them out, and her being the only one to be able to see them, before the party contacts her for her first time, when she'll be absolutely terrified.
 
The first time the party sees her, she is completely comfortable with these phantoms and addresses them as old friends that she can't really interact with.
